Na thuiskomst besloot Anne wat terug te gaan doen.  Bij toeval (of niet?) arriveerde er kort daarna een brief vanuit de school met het verzoek om te helpen met het bouwen van schoolbanken. Sindsdien ondersteunt Stichting Anne in Afrika de lokale bevolking met de realisatie van goede initiatieven in Tanzania, gericht op het verbeteren van de kwaliteit van leven van kinderen. De geboden ondersteuning bestaat uit concrete materialen, zoals schoolspullen, een generator, of een windmolen die stroom verschaft aan het opvanghuis voor kinderen die in de gevangenis van Arusha worden geboren. 

Stichting Anne in Afrika spaart sinds 2008 voor kinderen die wees zijn geworden omdat hun ouders aan AIDS overleden zijn. Deze kinderen kunnen nu nog naar school op het New Hope Education Centre, een lokale NGO. Maar de klaslokalen van deze school worden gehuurd, en sinds de verdubbeling in huurprijs vorig jaar zijn de lokalen onbetaalbaar geworden. Zonder eigen school zal het New Hope Education Centre ophouden te bestaan, wat letterlijk betekent dat de weeskinderen op straat komen te staan. Daarom is Stichting Anne in Afrika bezig geweest met de aankoop van een stuk grond om een eigen school voor het New Hope Education Centre op te kunnen bouwen. Inmiddels is het New Hope Education Centre de trotse eigenaar van een prachtig stuk grond van 4,5 acre! De komende tijd wordt stukje bij beetje de nieuwe school gebouwd, beginnend met een groot hek om het land ter bescherming van de bouwmaterialen en later de kinderen op de school. Na het hek volgen de klaslokalen, slaapvertrekken, keuken, groentetuin, etc. Zodra de benodigde fondsen binnen zijn, wordt gestart met de bouw. Uiteindelijk gaat de school plaats bieden aan 280 kinderen. De vorderingen zijn te volgen via www.anneinafrika.info. 

Stichting Anne in Afrika maakt een kleine 100 Euro kosten per jaar. Dit zijn kosten voor de Kamer van Koophandel en het hebben van een bankrekening. Eenieder die zich inzet voor Stichting Anne in Afrika doet dit geheel kosteloos en belangeloos. Stichting Anne in Afrika heeft geen strijkstok.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:56.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Wij ondersteunen lokale, grass-root jongeren initiatieven die autonomie en economische zelfredzaamheid bevorderen. Wij richten ons in het bijzonder op kunstzinnige en sportieve initiatieven. Caramundo is een non-profit die in Nederland vrijwel volledig draait op vrijwilligers.  

Caramundo is in 2004 officieel opgericht nadat wij al 2 jaar benefietfeesten en uitwisselingen organiseerden en fondsen wierven voor onze partnerorganisaties in Colombia en Brazilië. Omdat Caramundo tot op heden vrijwel volledig steunt op vrijwilligerswerk, varieert de organisatie regelmatig van samenstelling. Momenteel hebben wij een 4-koppig bestuur van professionals op het gebied van financiën, juridische zaken, bedrijfsvoering en ontwikkelingssamenwerking dat zich semi-actief met de dagelijkse gang van zaken van de stichting bemoeit. De organisatie bestaat uit een klein team van 5 vrijwilligers dat parttime werkzaamheden verricht in minder drukke periodes. Tijdens draagvlakversterkende evenementen kan het team zich uitbreiden tot gemiddeld 20 vrijwilligers die actief voor langere periode de productie doen van de evenementen. Het team wordt geleid door Anouk Piket, oprichtster en directeur van Caramundo. 

De rol van Caramundo is het ondersteunen van jongeren initiatieven in Latijns Amerika. Veel jongeren hebben goede ideeën maar hebben geen idee hoe ze die kunnen uitvoeren. In veel gebieden zijn een aantal grote NGO’s aan het werk, maar die hebben geen volledig draagvlak in alle wijken en juist de jongeren die geen geregistreerde entiteit zijn, vallen vaak buiten de boot. Die jongeren helpt Caramundo aan financiering, capaciteitsopbouwende activiteiten, de juiste contacten, coaching en ondersteuning in het opstellen van hun plannen, het maken van een dekkende begroting en het stapsgewijs uitvoeren van hun project. Caramundo is bij uitstek een bruggen bouwende instantie. Indien wij getalenteerde jongeren identificeren, doen wij ons best hen voor te stellen in de professionele wereld, waar zij eventueel stages en/of werk kunnen vinden om hun talenten te ontwikkelen en werkervaring op te bouwen. Daarnaast biedt Caramundo ondersteuning in het opstellen van een goed monitorings en evaluatie systeem en de registratie van een organisatie of kleine onderneming, om zelfstandig te kunnen functioneren, onafhankelijk van Caramundo. 

Projeto Queto is zo’n project. Ontstaan uit de wens van een lokale graffiti schrijver die voor een grote NGO in veel wijken in Rio de Janeiro en daarbuiten graffiti les gaf aan jongeren, maar niet in zijn eigen wijk. Hij wilde graag iets voor zijn eigen wijk doen en werkte samen met een groep locale leiders en met behulp van Caramundo, een plan uit om een cultureel centrum op te zetten waar graffiti één van de workshops zou zijn. 

Projeto Queto heeft inmiddels een langdurig proces achter de rug. Waar eerst niets was in de wijk, en waar mensen nauwelijks wisten hoe ze op een computer konden werken, is inmiddels een cultureel centrum opgericht dat volledig door henzelf wordt gerund. De registratie van een onafhankelijke organisatie is bijna voltooid, waardoor zij nu ook zelfstandig fondsen op locatie kunnen werven.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:26.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting 27266214","info@caramundo.org","Rabobank","121415074","","","Stichting Caramundo","Amsterdam","Netherlands","348","2009-12-14","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Hoe belangrijk persoonlijke aandacht is en hoe belangrijk liefde en begrip kunnen zijn. Dit doen wij door deze leerlingen bloot te stellen aan situaties die hun leeftijd ver vooruit gaat. Zowel hier in Nederland als in Peru. Een Exposure die zij de rest van hun leven meenemen, delen met anderen en mogelijk een andere kijk geeft op hun toekomstige situaties. Een verrijking voor deze leerlingen en een verrijking voor de kinderen van La Comunidad De Ninos Sagrada Familia, die zoveel liefde en steun kunnen gebruiken!","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:54.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Stichting Kasanka Nederland heeft als doelstelling om ondersteuning te bieden in en rond Kasanka National Park op het gebied van:
• Natuurbescherming en –beheer;
• Kleinschalige economische ontwikkeling; en
• Sociale projecten in het kader van community development, waaronder onderwijs

Kasanka National Park is sinds 1987 geprivatiseerd om het van verwaarlozing en ondergang te redden. Kasanka Trust Limited (KTL) is de particuliere organisatie die het park beheerd. De Trust is een Zambiaanse non-profit onderneming. Alle opbrengsten van het park gaan naar het beheer van het park en naar projecten die zijn gericht op de duurzame ontwikkeling van het park en de omgeving. Deze projecten worden samen met de inwoners uit de omliggende dorpen opgezet en uitgevoerd. De Stichting Kasanka Nederland (SKN) is in 2007 opgericht om de Kasanka Trust in Zambia in haar werk te ondersteunen. Doordat Stichting Kasanka Nederland geheel uit vrijwilligers bestaat, gaat al het ingezamelde geld ook direct naar de Kasanka Trust. Ook in Engeland en Wales zijn stichtingen in het leven geroepen om fondsen te werven voor Kasanka National Park.

Op dit moment bestaat Stichting Kasanka Nederland uit 4 bestuursleden en 4 vrijwilligers. Via fondsenwerving en particuliere giften zamelt de Stichting geld in om de bevolking te ondersteunen in hun streven naar duurzame ontwikkeling in het gebied waar ze wonen. Dit gebied grenst overwegend aan Nationaal Park Kasanka, Zambia. De Stichting levert hiermee bijdragen aan onder andere de kosten van wildwachters, onderzoek, voorlichting over natuurbescherming, en geeft studenten rond Kasanka National Park de mogelijkheid om naar de middelbare school te gaan. In 2008 heeft de Stichting substantieel bijgedragen aan de oprichting van een trainingscentrum voor natuurbeheer en duurzame landbouw. In 2009 heeft SKN al een project afgerond via de 1% Club (http://www.1procentclub.nl/projects/wildwachters/). De bedoeling was om een nieuwe patrouille-eenheid van wildwachters te trainen. Doordat er geen genoeg geld binnenkwam, is er besloten om van het binnengekomen geld nieuwe walkie talkies met 20 batterijen aan te schaffen (essentieel voor goede communicatie tussen wildwachterpatrouilles in het park) en rantsoenen voor 1 maand voor de wildwachters te kopen. Stichting Kasanka Nederland is door de Belastingdienst erkend als een goed doel (ANBI). Giften zijn daarom aftrekbaar. De Stichting is geheel afhankelijk van externe fondsen.

De Kasanka Trust Zambia heeft recent een project ontwikkeld waarin mens en olifant centraal staan. De nadruk ligt op verbetering van de voedselzekerheid van de lokale bevolking en op het behoud van de olifantenpopulatie.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:50:43.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","ANBI

Van lokale mensen kreeg ik (Menno Staarink) een rondrit kreeg door de zuidelijke wijken van Cochabamba. Daar zag ik dat hele stadswijken zonder basisvoorzieningen zoals stromend water en energie zaten en dat de weinige onderwijsinstellingen te kort schoten. Mij werd gevraagd om te onderzoeken of vanuit Nederland hulp mogelijk was. Van daar uit is stichting Samay opgericht. 

Als eerste richtten we ons op onderwijsprojecten in deze wijk van Cochabamba en hielpen we met het opzetten van 2 bibliotheekjes/ huiswerkklassen. 
Vervolgens gingen we aan de slag met een kinderopvang. Deze werd gerealiseerd in het laagland van Bolivia in het dorpje Tumupasha. 


Tegenwoordig leggen we de focus op milieu - en armoedebestrijding projecten. Zo hebben we al een groot project achter de rug met zonnelampen, erosiebestrijding en boomaanplant.

Our projects help people that have difficulty finding their place in society both in the Netherlands and in development countries. We collect used materials (f.i. computers, tools, bicycles and sewing machines) in the Netherlands and have them repaired and revised by people with a distance to the labour market. These revised goods are then shipped to development countries to provide people there a chance for a better life. With the help of volunteers we do not only send materials but also the knowledge how to use them to development countries.

In the Netherlands we have a solidarity workshop of approximately 30 to 40 people, existing out of volunteers and people that are in some sort of re-integration situation.

Yolande heeft toen het bedrijfsleven verlaten om een eigen onderneming te starten. Als reisliefhebber heeft de oprichtster van Commundo meer dan 25 landen in de wereld bezocht. Het idee om een reisorganisatie te beginnen dat een bijzondere manier van reizen aanbiedt, is ontstaan uit haar eigen behoefte. De mooiste herinneringen aan de reizen zijn de ontmoetingen met de lokale bevolking. Een goede manier om echt in contact te komen met de lokale mensen, is door het doen van vrijwilligerswerk.

Commundo is een stichting waarbij de doelstelling is: ‘het bijdragen aan een betere wereld door het aanbieden van reizen waarin door het samen werken in ontwikkelingsprojecten meer wederzijds begrip ontstaat tussen mensen uit verschillende culturen’. De stichting is een non-profit organisatie. 

Commundo levert een dienst waarbij zij reizen organiseren voor iedereen van 18-79 jaar dat gecombineerd wordt met vrijwilligerswerk. Commundo levert dus reizen die beide zijden van een land belichten: de mooie highlights die landen te bieden hebben aan toeristen, maar ook het (zware) dagelijkse leven van de lokale bevolking. Naast het rondreizend ontdekken van de cultuur, is het actief participeren in ontwikkelingsprojecten een belangrijk onderdeel van Commundo- reizen. Hiermee wordt zowel de lokale bevolking als de deelnemer zelf letterlijk een ervaring rijker. Stichting Commundo is in 2003 gestart met het aanbieden van reizen naar Guatemala. Inmiddels is Commundo uitgegroeid en heeft haar aanbod uitgebreid met de landen Zuid-Afrika, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Roemenië en Suriname. In deze landen probeert Commundo verschillende soorten projecten aan te bieden die onder te verdelen zijn in 3 groepen:
-	Sociale projecten
-	Natuurprojecten
-	Bouwprojecten","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:37.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Geïnspireerd door het verhaal van de uitgebrande truck van het Enidado project is ons idee voor Moving Forward ontstaan. Enidado is het oesterzwammen project van stichting Imagine. Door de brand stagneert hun project en het brengt zelfs de continuïteit van de hele lokale onderneming in gevaar. Zo werd het idee geboren om een ‘nieuwe truck’ te brengen en zo direct bij te dragen aan de voortgang van een goed duurzaam initiatief. Onder vrienden en bekenden in onze directe omgeving bleken echter meer van dit soort inspirerende initiatieven te bestaan met dezelfde behoefte aan vervoer. Wij als young professionals besloten een stichting op te richten om onze bijdrage leveren aan meer dan onze eigen carrière en omgeving! We zullen doorgaan totdat het een succes is geworden!
Het Moving Forward project brengt auto’s naar duurzame ontwikkelingsprojecten die op het punt staan om als kleine onderneming zelfstandig te kunnen voortbestaan. Door gebrek aan mobiliteit kunnen zij zich momenteel moeilijk verder ontwikkelen. Daarom brengen wij met een team van negen vrijwilligers in februari 2011 vier auto’s naar deze startende duurzame ondernemingen en projecten in Mali en Ghana. Hierdoor kunnen zij bijvoorbeeld materialen inkopen, producten verkopen, klanten in een grotere regio bereiken en medewerkers vervoeren. 
Goed om te weten is dat de aanschaf van een auto in Afrika duurder is dan de aanschaf in Europa en het transport naar Afrika. Het onderhoud is daarentegen veel goedkoper. 
Het project Moving Forward heeft verschillende deelprojecten die gemeenschappelijk hebben dat ze kennis op gebied van ondernemen en duurzame technologie overbrengen. We bouwen bijvoorbeeld biogasinstallaties in Mali, leren jonge gehandicapten een bakkerij te starten, leren de lokale bevolking op zonne-energie te koken en bouwen windmolens. We zorgen ook voor publiciteit onderweg om de mogelijkheden van duurzame energie te promoten.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:50:45.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvKnr 51150131","j.tamis@tudelft.nl","Rabobank","158043847","NL03RABO0158043847","RABONL2U","Stichting Katalysator","Eleanor Rooseveltlaan 29","Netherlands","825","2010-12-23","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Established in 2005, the organisation is staffed by a group of young proactive youths who are convinced that development does not lie in the hands of the elderly alone, but also in those of the youths. The overarching goal of YPPD is to contribute to the endeavours of supporting youth development, peaceful conflict resolution, stability and sustainable development and peace and democracy in Sierra Leone. YPPD works to increase the capacity of vulnerable groups through training, partnership, advocacy, enhancing youth knowledge base and equipping them with livelihood skills. It is a platform for diverse kinds of actions committed to engaging key stakeholders at different levels of development across the country.

Our strategic programme areas include youth enterprise development, access to justice, gender empowerment through education and training, geared towards increasing youth capacity and knowledge in enjoyment of their human rights, fundamental freedoms and participation in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

This has subsequently made the organization one of the fastest growing youth organization in Sierra Leone and with a growing international membership of more than 250 young people the world over through the web-based social network called “YPPD YOUTH NETWORK”


The organization however was borne out of the desire of bringing young people onboard who can serve agitators and agents of change and activists in their respective communities for the promotion of advocacy and youth empowerment in nation building. 

It holds a conviction on young people as agents of positivism in terms of national development, thereby strongly believing that as young people there is the call for us to come together and build the buoyancy needed in others, as a possible way of enabling youth in stepping forward for positive changes in our various communities and the world at large. With our vision, we develop insight from the daily struggles of our fellow young people who are marginalized and voiceless in the communities they live. This initiative is entirely managed for and by young people in Sierra Leone, which we consider as a novelty in the lives of every young person trying to make a change.

YPPD seeks to provide a ‘youthful voice’ that seeks to address the numerous challenges facing leaders of tomorrow by effectively using young resourceful minds to influence the course of inclusive policy formulation and development in a consistent and harmonized manner. 


OUR VISION
YPPD envisions a society wherein young people can maximize their potentials in development that affect their lives through enhancing their capabilities and enabling them to affirm control over their life circumstances. 


OUR MISSION
Our mission is to advocate, inform, involve, inspire and celebrate social change led by and for youths through a multifaceted approach. We connect with organizations and individuals with a view to supporting young people, and build alliances between youth groups, developing and empowering the marginalized and vulnerable youth of Sierra Leone.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:25.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","	Registered with the government of Sierra Leone through the Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs

We worden regelmatig ondersteund door homeopaten en andere vrijwilligers uit Nederland en andere Europese landen die belangeloos een periode op het centrum verblijven. Het centrum vervult inmiddels een regionale functie. Er werken circa 50 lokale mensen.
Naast de polikliniek is er ook een kraamkliniek, wordt een project voor weeskinderen uitgevoerd, krijgen weeskinderen een vakopleiding en wordt o.a. voedselhulp geboden.

Wereld. Het zwaartepunt van de projecten ligt op het gebied van educatie.
Het bestuur van onze stichting bestaat uit 6 mensen. Daarnaast hebben we 2 projectmedewerksters, 2 veldmedewerksters en 3 adviseurs. Allemaal vrijwilligers.
Het initiatief voor dit project komt van de voorzitter Marijke den Ridder en de penningmeester Jacques den Ridder. Zij zijn ook de oprichters van de stichting Focus on Education.
Jacques is vanaf 1996 drie tot vier keer per jaar voor zijn werkgever Rabobank naar Sri Lanka gegaan om een cooperatieve bank op te zetten. Iedere keer reisde Marijke op eigen kosten mee. Het begon met het steunen van een ziekenhuis, scouting en naaischolen. Ze merkten allebei dat hun hart lag bij mensen, dat ze heel graag mensen wilden helpen. 
Uiteindelijk besloten ze 28-08-2002 officieel stichting Focus on Education op te richten. Hierna zijn er vele projecten gerealiseerd in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, Gambia en Congo. 
In Congo zijn er eerder al projecten gerealiseerd, zoals de bouw van 6 klaslokalen, lerarenkamer/kantoor, bibliotheek en toiletgebouw voor de farm of hope school in Kiliba. (01-05-2007 - 01-03-2008).
Ook is er een vakopleiding gerealiseerd voor de ex-kindsoldaten. Denk hierbij aan houtbewerking, kleding maken en omgaan met computers.

mensen met een psychische ziekte;
mensen met een verstandelijke beperking;  
mensen die ten gevolge van omstandigheden in psychische nood zijn geraakt, zoals HIV/AIDS, oorlogshandelingen en natuurrampen

Geestelijke gezondheidszorg dicht bij huis (extramurale zorg);  
Ondersteuning van mensen met verstandelijke beperkingen; 
HIV/AIDS en geestelijke gezondheidszorg;  
Geestelijke gezondheidszorg en mensenrechten

Dit doet zij door voor de korte termijn te voorzien in eerste levensbehoeften en voor de lange termijn door ervoor te zorgen dat mensen in eigen levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien. De doelstelling wordt gerealiseerd door:
•       Het bieden van basisbehoefte en basisvoorzieningen (voedsel, medische  zorg en educatie)
•       Het ondersteunen van lokale initiatieven door het verstrekken van  financiële middelen of 		goederen
•       Het creëren van werkgelegenheid
•       Het creëren van bewustzijn en het genereren van steun in Nederland en Colombia.

Deze nieuwe stichting is opgericht in 2009 en zet zich in om de leefomstandigheden voor de minder bedeelden in het dorp Paluato (voorheen Ipauratu) Colombia te verbeteren. De focus voor de aankomende jaren ligt op het mogelijk maken van onderwijs voor kleuters.

De samenstelling van de stichting ziet er als volgt uit:
Voorzitter: Morris Hoppenbrouwers
Bestuurslid: Maartje Nijkamp
Penningmeester: Laurens van Vliet

Inten (de bestuurder van de partnerorganisatie) is de moeder van Morris (de voorzitter van de Nederlandse organisatie). Zij is jaren geleden een Colombiaanse man tegen gekomen toen zij nog op Curacao woonde. Zij hebben al jarenlang een relatie en hebben 10 jaar geleden besloten om naar Colombia te verhuizen. Daar heeft zij een winkel met sieraden in het toeristische gedeelte van Cartagena (Noord-Colombia). De jaren voordat zij in Cartagena woonden, zaten zij in het dorp Galapa, dat vlakbij Paluato ligt. Haar droom was altijd om de kinderen van Colombia te helpen met een betere toekomst en een jaar geleden is zij samen met haar man dit initiatief begonnen.

Morris is mijn zwager en wij hebben samen met zijn vrouw de stichting opgericht (Jolene Blom). Mijn vriendin en ik (Laurens) zijn twee jaar geleden nog in Colombia geweest (1 week Cartagena en 3 weken gereisd) en Morris is met zijn vrouw begin dit jaar geweest.

Toen we hoorden dat het project van inentingen goed was verlopen hebben we besloten om ook vanuit Nederland te helpen. Dit hebben we toen maar meteen serieus opgepakt door het opzetten van een stichting.

Mijn vriendin en ik hebben de afgelopen jaren ook nog behoorlijk gereisd en ook nog voor een korte periode vrijwilligerswerk gedaan in Cambodja. Dit heeft ons ook weer het besef gegeven, dat we vanuit hier veel voor de mensen in arme landen kunnen betekenen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:18.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Daar zagen zij hoe de Guatemalteekse bevolking in grote armoede leefde. Ze waren verbaasd over het feit dat slechts een kleine percentage van de kinderen naar school ging. In april 2006 deed één van hen via het internet een oproep aan vrienden en familie om geld te geven aan de school waarop hij werkte en zo de arme kinderen van de school te helpen. Zijn oproep werd massaal gehonoreerd en veel mensen gaven een donatie. In Guatemala zelf werden de mensen ook enthousiast over zijn initiatief en veel mensen boden hun hulp aan. Samen startten zij de organisatie, Niños de Guatemala. In Nederland richtten zij samen de stichting Niños de Guatemala Nederland op, om vanuit Nederland het werk van de Guatemalteekse NGO te ondersteunen.

De NDG is een organisatie die zich inzet voor een betere toekomst van Guatemalteekse kinderen en jongeren, daar waar dit het hardst nodig is. In Nederland werft NDG fondsen en donaties en in Guatemala ondersteunt NDG jongeren- en gemeenschapsprojecten.

De NDG heeft in Guatemala een Guatemalteekse NGO opgericht om het werk in Guatemala te coördineren. De NGO wordt gezamenlijk bestuurd door zowel Nederlandse vrijwilligers vanuit Nederland die full-time in Guatemala zijn en Guatemalteken. De NGO is de eigenaar van alle bezittingen (zoals de school) en stuurt middels een dagelijks bestuur (executive board – met 4 leden) en een algemeen bestuur (met 5 leden) de organisatie aan. De operationele activiteiten van NDG spelen zich af in de school Nuestro Futuro in Ciudad Vieja en het NDG Volunteer Center (Centro de Voluntariados) in Antigua. De school Nuestro Futuro is het charitatieve project. Daarnaast is er het Centro de Voluntariodos. 

Om lokale betrokkenheid te vergroten wordt het meeste werk ter plaatse door Guatemalteken verricht onder begeleiding van de NGO. Het idee is dat NDG de lokale organisatie professioneel begeleidt en ondersteunt, en dat de centrale rollen zoveel mogelijk door Guatemalteken zelf worden vervuld.  

De leerkrachten van de school komen allemaal uit Guatemala en zijn, omdat er in Guatemala een overschot is aan gediplomeerde leerkrachten, uit een grote groep geselecteerd. Zij worden op dit moment nog betaald door de NDG in Nederland, maar het is de bedoeling dat de school in vijf jaar volledig zelfstandig zal opereren.

NDG aims to realize its mission by initiating and supporting small-scale education-based development projects where they are most needed: according to NDG education is
the most important part of a developing community, which in the end aims to sustain its own needs and create its own opportunities. Local involvement, community development, and self-sufficiency are central to NDG's educational projects. With the aim of contributing to a better future for underprivileged Guatemalans NDG initiates and supports community projects, thereby involving and developing the local community, particularly children. NDG Guatemala has two 'Business Units' which focus on the two most important tasks NDG has. The first focuses on the charity in the form of education to those children who need it most: the elementary school Nuestro Futuro. The second aims to attract
recourses to the organization so as to support the charity: the Volunteer Center. In the end NDG would like to expand the amount of charitable Business Units.

Nuestro Futuro is an elementary school in Ciudad Vieja. It was built in 2008 by NDG and started with children aged 5 through 9 in 2009 (total 71 pupils, 8 employees). Every year, as the children pass through to the next grade, there is a new intake of children into the school, so by 2014 we hope to have around 200 pupils. Additionally, NDG has built a second floor that shall house more classrooms for the growing amount of children attending Nuestro Futuro. Also, NDG is working on the installation of a Community Center, a library, a computer lab, and a cafeteria on the second floor so as to serve the community of Ciudad Vieja with more educational opportunities.

The Volunteer Center is located in Antigua. The goal of the Volunteer Center is primarily to recruit volunteers and raise funds to support Nuestro Futuro. To achieve this, the Volunteer Center organizes a broad range of activities (4 employees) In order to reach self sustainability in the future the Volunteer Center focuses on raising funds in Guatemala, and on the commitment of the Guatemalan middle class. The volunteers recruited help out at the school by supporting teachers during classes and providing children with extra curricular activities in the afternoon.

The NGO has a Supervisory Board (Junta Directiva) that consists of five members and an Executive Board (Junta Ejecutiva, 1 employee) that consists of four. The Boards are responsible for the unity of
NDG (Nuestro Futuro, Volunteer Center, and the NGO) and for planning and control.

NDG Guatemala’s office is located in Antigua. This UNESCO city hosts a lively and busy tourist scene. As of 2010 Niños de Guatemala works together with Academia Colonial a Spanish school, where NDG has its office free of charge. The office is located in the center of Antigua and is the working space of all employees except those that work at the school in Ciudad Vieja. At the beginning of 2010 the NDG team in Guatemala consisted of a total of 15 employees. At Nuestro Futuro we work with 4 teachers, a social worker, a cooking lady, a manager of operations and the director. The Volunteer Center consists of an operations manager, a director, a padrino coordinator and a volunteer coordinator. The latter manages all volunteers (an average of 8 of all kind of nationalities). The NGO as a unit taking care of all finances and legal representation is managed by the president, a manager of operations and a bookkeeping assistant.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:13.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NDG in Guatemala is a Guatemalan non-profit NGO (Organización No Gubernamental) subject to Guatemalan law.

Our mission is to enhance opportunities for Men, Women, Youths and Children who are living in circumstances of Social and Economic disadvantage, to get a good start in life and to make a fuller contribution to tomorrow’s families, communities and societies in which they live.
Our thematic focus:
1. Rural Water, Hygiene and Sanitation
2. Food and Agriculture
3. Women’s right and empowerment
4. Micro Enterprises Development Project 
Main Issues about Water and Sanitation approach.

The hunger problem in our operational areas is water problem. This is because drought destroys crops and kills animals. The people grow weak and sick because they do eat and drink enough water. The people in our operational areas are suffering needlessly because water is scares. The sad Irony is that often there is enough water to save thousands just 50-85 feet underground. It is so close and yet too far for people lacking the tools and know-how to reach it.

FID/SL has been mobilizing local resources and provide the technique required to provide water in her operational areas.

Major Issues on our Agricultural Business and Micro Enterprises Development Program

Collapse of domestic infrastructure including our local industries as a result of imbalances in local market/trade system in FID operational areas in the Bo and Pujehun districts, increased our focus on our agricultural support to not only providing tools, seeds and training in post harvest management, but to find ways on how local farm producers could get more income from their products.

FID believes that businesses don’t operate—and can’t thrive—in isolation. FID improves the productivity and competitiveness of local industries and ensures that small producers benefit from participation. For the fastest and most extensive and enduring gains, we identify growth opportunities and alleviate growth constraints along an entire value chain or within clusters of value chains, from input supply and production to processing and delivery into final markets. Practices include
1. Advocating policies that limit farmers efficiency and market responsiveness
2. Expanding access to finance, market information, new markets, technology and training
3. Promoting collaboration between local farmers and other service providers to increase efficiency, develop mutually beneficial relationships, advocate interests to government and set standards","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:01.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","REG.

Deze aanpak is de meest effectieve en efficiënte vorm van bestrijding – of eigenlijk voorkoming- van kindersterfte. 

Stichting Max is in 2004 opgericht door Steven en Joke Le Poole naar aanleiding van het overlijden van hun 8 maanden oude zoontje. Om iets positiefs te laten groeien uit zijn verlies hebben zij Stichting Max opgericht. 

Inmiddels is de stichting sterk gegroeid, bestaat het bestuur uit 7 leden en zetten daarnaast een aantal vrijwilligers zich in voor de stichting. 

Sinds de oprichting in 2004 heeft Stichting Max meer dan 800 dorpen (ongeveer 160.000 mensen) op het platteland van Bangladesh voorzien van Micro-Sanitatie. 

Stichting Max hanteert de volgende uitgangspunten bij haar werk:

1. Donaties gaan voor 100% naar de bestemmingen in het veld. Alle operationele kosten in Nederland worden door het bestuur gedragen of er wordt naar vrijwilligers gezocht;

2. Projecten worden geselecteerd op basis van ontwikkelingsrendement (maximaal resultaat per euro ontwikkelingshulp);

3. De Stichting geeft directe feedback over de bestedingen van donaties.

Dit doet zij door voor de korte termijn te voorzien in eerste levensbehoeften en voor de lange termijn door ervoor te zorgen dat mensen in eigen levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien. De doelstelling wordt gerealiseerd door:
• Het bieden van basisbehoefte en 
  basisvoorzieningen (voedsel, medische zorg 
  en educatie)
• Het ondersteunen van lokale initiatieven door 
  het verstrekken van financiële middelen of 
  goederen
• Het creëren van werkgelegenheid
• Het creëren van bewustzijn en het genereren 
  van steun in Nederland en Colombia.

Deze stichting is eind 2009 opgericht en zet zich in om de leefomstandigheden voor de minder bedeelden in het dorp Paluato (voorheen Ipauratu) Colombia te verbeteren. De focus voor de aankomende jaren ligt op het mogelijk maken van onderwijs voor kleuters.

Met drie goede vrienden (Remco, Morris en ik) gaan we ons inzetten om fondsen te werven voor een vervoersmiddel voor stichting mijn huis in Ipauratu Colombia. 

Wij (Remco, Morris en ik) zijn alle drie zelf vaker betrokken bij acties voor het goede doelen. Zo ben ik samen met Remco in 2005 voor de Amsterdam Dakar Challange naar Gambia gereden om een auto te doneren aan een plaatselijk goed doel. Ook heb ik recent de 1%Club geholpen met het organiseren en produceren van hun jaarlijkse 1%Event. Morris is bestuur is bestuurslid van Stichting mijn huis in Ipauratu Colombia.

WOM provides them temporary shelter and food, legal assistance (to claim their right to land), skills training, help in accessing healthcare and access to a micro-credit program for those wanting to start up a small business or enterprise. They also support the children by providing assistance with payment of school fees', uniforms and books.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:50.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO","womghana2000@yahoo.com","National Investment Bank (NIB)","1000200404101","","NIBGGHAC","Widows and Orphans Movement","Ayia Road","Ghana","1584","2012-07-17","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

It was formed to organize the youth and women under one forum and offer them a platform of cooperation in promotion of human rights and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns, support of Orphans and activities of self-reliance for sustainable social economic development.  Currently the organization is working with groups of youth and women and we encourage those without groups to organize themselves in small economic groups. The women’s group comprises of women living with HIV most of whom are widowed with big families to take care of. The women engage in subsistence farming where by food production is mainly for home consumption and very little or none at all is left for commercial purposes. As a result the women are in absolute poverty. In an attempt to address the above problem, the women organized themselves under a support group involved in handcraft making in 2000.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:18.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Youth and Women Empowerment (YAWE) Foundation is a Non Government Organization registered by the Government of Uganda.

Dit doel proberen wij te bereiken door plaatselijke projecten te ondersteunen.
Sinds 2007 heeft stichting Mheer voor Fako de volgende projecten gerealiseerd: 1 Aanschaf van 45 schooluniformen voor kansarme kinderen van Fako (Kei besar) zodat zij het basisonderwijs kunnen volgen. 2 Bouw van extra schoollokaal en bouw toiletten. 3 Renovatie schoolgebouw na een zware storm. 4 Aanleg schoolplein voor sport en spel.
Vanaf juni 2009 lopen de volgende projecten:  * tuin en kleinveeprojecten voor weduw en alleenstaande vrouwen op Kei kecil.  *Financiele ondersteuning aan kansarme kinderen van Fako voor middelbaar onderwijs. Voor dit laatste project vragen wij een bedrag van 2500,- voor het bouwen van wasruimten en toiletten bij de woonruimte voor 24 middelbaar scholieren. Deze kansarme kinderen kunnen niet thuis wonen omdat de afstand van huis naar school lang en zeer moeizaam is. Er is geen openbaar vervoer en lopen is bijna niet mogelijk om dagelijks op tijd op school aan te komen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:21.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting Mheer voor Fako staat ingeschreven bij de Kamer van Koophandel onder nummer:14095692

Aloisi lempruk,and SAiboku Lepatoye. Waso Rongai is the biggest primary school in the area, having around 500 children. The community is a 3500 peoples. MRDF (Methodist Relief Funds), SIP collaborate with ministry of livestock in buying of animals, vet drugs and giving good management of camels. The three areas where the board members hail from is Waso Rongai, latakenye and sereriti.

Mission of the organization

Our mission is to initiate community driven sustainable development among the pastoralist communities in Samburu District, alleviate poverty and enable them to overcome their problems with dignity.
Organisation background
Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) is a Non Governmental Organization whose major focus is to address poverty and other development needs of the Pastoralist communities in Samburu District. 
Formed and registered in the year 2000, Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) employs a comprehensive community based approach where community led initiatives is the basis of our projects and activities. 
Over the years, in partnership with the community and local and international donors, SIP has had a meaningful contribution to improved standards of living lifestyles for the pastoralist households in Samburu District through humanitarian aid, micro enterprise development, community training and education support.
IN support education SIP assisted the Waso Rongai community to put up six class rooms and a dormitory and therefore enable their children to go to school. This was an initiative where the strong community ownership was utilized to realize maximum community contribution and participation. The same school was assisted to improve its school feeding Programme through a dairy goat project that was supported by MRDF(Methodist Relief Development Funds). Six women groups have received technical and financial support from SIP through training on entrepreneurial skills and provision of small grants and revolving loans. 

Our latest support to the community through funding from MRDF (Methodist Relief Development Funds) has ensured the communities engage in and adopt beekeeping as a source of livelihood having trained 80 beekeepers and supply of 120 beehives both in Ndoto and Nyiro locations.

HIV/AIDS has become a reality in Samburu District and SIP came up with a strategy to reach the Moran’s who are the sexually active group by distributing condoms through young men we termed as informed friends. The project also intervened during the mass circumcision and ensured that transmission of HIV/AIDS is not propagated by use of one knife for the boys.

In the overall SIP aims to achieve the following objectives.
1.	Develop alternative means of earning a living parallel to nomadic pastoralist as a way of protecting livelihoods from the effects of drought and poverty.

2.	Protect and preserve the cultural heritage of the Samburu people e.g. Wildlife, forests, culture, and other natural resources.

3.	Promote the development of markets for livestock and livestock products. 

4.	To enhance and improve access to preventive and curative health services by supporting and stocking health facilities in the most underserved areas of Samburu District. 

        Governance
SIP works in collaboration with local government authorities to best define the needs in the community and as all the staff and Board members are from the region, they are well placed to identify the needs of the communities in which they work. The Board is composed of 4 men and 1 woman, who are all from the 3 areas in which SIP operates. Some Board members still live in Samburu, but others are based in Nairobi, however they keep in communication, hold regular meetings and can be called upon at any time.

Binnen SHF zijn bestuur, beleid en werkuitvoering professioneel georganiseerd. SHF heeft een klein stafbureau in Utrecht, dat wordt bijgestaan door denktanks. Daarin zitten creatieve en deskundige experts die SHF op allerlei terrein ondersteunen en adviseren. Op die manier zijn er ruim 70 mensen actief betrokken bij SHF. Al vanaf de oprichting door de huidige directeur, Wim Stroecken, in 2003 staat transparantie bij SHF hoog in het vaandel. De overhead wordt bewust zo laag mogelijk gehouden. Zo kan SHF de beschikbare middelen optimaal gebruiken voor de mensen voor wie ze bedoeld zijn. Momenteel voeren we projecten uit in Bolivia, Kenia en Zuid-Soedan samen met lokale partners. SHF houdt zich voornamelijk bezig met het algehele programma management en de lange termijn strategie en de partners zijn voornamelijk bij de daadwerkelijke uitvoering van het project betrokken.

Vervolgens betrekt SC Zambia lokale organisaties die deze trainingen kunnen geven, en zet de vraag voor kennis uit bij SC Nederland. Financiering voor investeringen wordt gevraagd aan donoren in Zambia maar ook via SC Nederland aan geldschieters in Nederland/Europa. SC Zambia volgt het project net zo lang als nodig is, nu rekenen we op zeker 10 jaar. De andere organisaties monitoren met name de effecten van de trainingen die ze zelf gegeven hebben. Ook zij zijn vaak een aantal jaar aanwezig. SC Nederland monitort het project ook, door bezoeken van bestuursleden en uiteraard de vrijwillgers.
Source Connection Nederland heeft 6 bestuursleden en 5 permanent actieve vrijwilligers. Daarnaast zijn er vrijwilligers actief voor kortere periodes. 
Source Connection Zambia bestaat uit een bestuur van 3 mensen en de lokale projectcoordinator.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:15.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Vanuit Nederland leveren wij financiële, publicitaire, personele en morele ondersteuning aan de organisaties REMER en Sparta, die in de krottenwijken en op straat in Rio de Janeiro actief zijn. Met name REMER biedt hulpverlening van A tot Z: niet alleen eerstelijns hulp op straat, maar ook permanente opvang, resocialisatie en onderwijs. 

Sparta is een sportvereniging die binnen de krottenwijk behalve sportactiviteiten ook basiseducatie en sociaal-maatschappelijk werk ontplooit. 

Onze missie is om straatkinderen te helpen bij hun dagelijkse strijd om het bestaan. In de praktijk betekent dit dat we sinds 1988 vooral financiële ondersteuning geven aan REMER en Sparta. Ook verzenden wij af en toe kleine hoeveelheden medicijnen, speelgoed of andere materialen naar Brazilië. Daarnaast komt ieder kwartaal een nieuwsbrief uit en geven wij regelmatig presentaties in kerken en op scholen. 

Bovendien werft 'Help mij leven' in Nederland vrijwilligers om een periode in Brazilië te helpen. Waar mogelijk staan we de medewerkers van Sparta en REMER met raad en daad bij.

Inmiddels bestaat NAFASI uit een gevarieerde en internationale groep van vrijwilligers. 
Ons doel is aandacht richten op scholieren in achterbuurten in ontwikkelingslanden, met name in Kameroen. Met dit project willen we de hoop teruggeven aan de jongeren en hen stimuleren om het verschil in andermans leven te maken door bewust te zijn van hun kracht. We willen ook dat de hulp direct bij de bewoners komt.
 
ONZE MISSIE
De missie van NAFASI op ontwikkelingssamenwerking is kort en krachtig. Elk kind verdient een kans op goed onderwijs.
Wij zetten ons in voor schoolkinderen in Kameroen. Wij willen hen ondersteunen in hun ontwikkeling door ze te helpen leren “kansen te creëren”. 

Door scholen te ondersteunen met financiële middelen en school materiaal, willen wij kinderen de hoop geven op een betere toekomst.

An artificial leg costs only fifty dollars, so we’ll put 500 dollars together to achieved our goal.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Donate a leg Foundation

Havonos doet dit door het bieden van structurele hulp op agrarisch, educatief en sociaal gebied. Het doel is het verbeteren van de levensstandaard en het verhogen van de zelfredzaamheid van de plaatselijke bevolking, zodat een situatie ontstaat waarin ontwikkeling mogelijk is. 

Havonos is een fondsenwervende instelling met een bestuur bestaande uit 5 personen, een comité van aanbeveling en veel vrijwilligers (23). 

Havonos werkt nauw samen met partnerorganisatie SAC (Social Action Committee), een stichting aldaar, opgericht door Pastor Gunam, welke stichting evenals Havonos, volkomen neutraal zonder enige politieke of religieuze binding, hulp biedt. 

Stichting Havonos heeft er voor gekozen om zich samen met het SAC op een aantal concrete projecten te richten. Momenteel zijn dit een naaimachineproject voor vrouwen (aanvraag bij de 1%CLUB) en de bouw van o.a. een toiletunit, de renovatie en inrichting van een school(deze aanvraag ligt bij NCDO). Inmiddels heeft stichting Havonos al ondersteuning mogen ontvangen van diverse Nederlandse organisaties en hiermee een substantiële bijdrage geleverd aan de reeds geboekte successen. Voor meer informatie verwijzen wij u graag naar onze website: www.havonos.nl.

Beide stichtingen werken volkomen belangeloos, op vrijwillige basis, dus zonder enige betaling.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Doelgroep hierbij is de bevolking in Iquitos te Peru. De stichting focust zich op het brengen van speciaal melkpoeder naar baby’s en peuters die ondervoed zijn. Bijvoorbeeld doordat de moeder geen borstvoeding kan geven. Ondervoede kinderen ontwikkelen zich niet goed. Goede voeding is het begin van alle leven en elk kind heeft daar recht op. Door de kinderen melk te geven hoopt de stichting dat zij later sterk zijn en zich goed ontwikkelen, waardoor zij een goede toekomst tegemoet gaan.

Naast het helpen van ondervoede kindjes zet Leche de Luz zich in zodat moeders een opleiding kunnen volgen (naailessen of een computeropleiding) zodat de moeder op de lange termijn voor het levensonderhoud van haar gezin kan zorgen.

Drijfkracht achter de stichting is de Nederlandse Loes de Wild. Van oorsprong werkte Loes als secretaresse en deed al jarenlang aan vrijwilligerswerk in Nederland en het buitenland. Loes deed vrijwilligerswerk bij kinderhuis Arcolris, opvanghuis voor tienermoeders voor stichting Caritas, voedselproject SEPAP en het Rode Kruis. Tijdens haar vrijwilligerswerk kwam zij vaak op de kinder- en kraamafdeling in de regeringsziekenhuizen in Iquitos (Noord-Peru). Daar kwam ze in aanraking met kinderen die zwaar ondervoed waren en stierven. Na twee jaar vrijwilligerswerk in Iquitos gedaan te hebben, besloot zij om een eigen stichting op te richten en zich in te zetten voor voeding voor kinderen jonger dan twee jaar. Ze begon de lokale stichting Leche de Luz. Loes zelf leeft van de overlijdensverzekering van haar man, die in 2003 kwam te overlijden. 

Tot nu toe zijn al enkele baby’s en peuters geholpen in de weeshuizen en twee ziekenhuizen. Momenteel focust Leche de Luz zich vooral op de familie Capinoa Aguituari. Een familie met vijf kinderen (de moeder heeft in maart een drieling gehad). Leche de Luz regelde genoeg voeding voor de drieling en heeft daarnaast dankzij een eenmalige donatie een huisje geregeld voor de rondzwervende familie. 

Leche de Luz wil wel uitbreiden en nog meer kinderen helpen, maar houdt zich momenteel bewust klein omdat er te weinig geld is. Kinderen die geholpen worden, blijft de stichting volgen totdat zij tenminste twee jaar oud zijn en goed vast voedsel kunnen opnemen. De stichting focust zich voor nu enkel op pasgeboren baby’s en jonge kinderen tot twee jaar oud, zodat zij zich alsnog goed kunnen ontwikkelen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:44:24.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Het project is in 2008 gestart, onder de naam Christian Vision Uganda, met de bouw van een Trainingscentrum. De projectleider is Jackson Kasozi. Hij werd ondersteund door de stichting in Engeland, Christian Hope International.

Vanaf  2011 is de naam Matendo actief geworden. Deze naam is een paraplu voor alle ontwikkelingsactiviteiten die in en rondom het Trainingscentrum plaatsvinden.

In 2011 is in Nederland de stichting Matendo opgericht. Deze stichting werkt projectmatig en richt zich met name op de watervoorziening in de regio Kibaale.

De begeleidingscommissie in Uganda bestaat uit 8 personen en is verantwoordelijk voor de beleidsontwikkeling en begeleiding. De projectleider Jackson Kasozi heeft de dagelijkse leiding. In Nederland zijn er binnen de Stichting Matendo twee personen actief.

De aanleiding van het project was de toename van het aantal weeskinderen, ten gevolge van Hiv/Aids, in de regio Kibaale en de slechte omstandigheden omtrent de watervoorziening. Er zijn steeds meer jongeren die geen mogelijkheid hebben om voortgezet onderwijs te volgen. Het Trainingscentrum gaat jongeren een kans bieden om praktische beroepsvaardigheden aan te leren om zodoende te kunnen voorzien in hun eigen levensonderhoud.  De trainingen zullen naar verwachting in september 2012 kunnen starten.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.

Het ontstaan van de Stichting

In 2002 gingen Mariska Versteegh en Evelien Kremer voor het eerst naar Ecuador. Zij werkten daar als vrijwilligsters in verschillende kinderdagverblijven in de hoofdstad Quito en leerden elkaar daar kennen. Ze werden geraakt door de armoede die ze daar zagen en de vele straatkinderen die ze ontmoetten. De kinderen in de arme wijken van de hoofdstad van Ecuador hebben weinig tot geen kans op een beter bestaan. Hun moeders zijn vaak minderjarig of alleenstaand en zien geen kans om uit de vicieuze cirkel van armoede te komen. Terug in Nederland richtten zij in 2003 stichting Niños de Waita Ticca op. Vervolgens vertrok Mariska Versteegh naar Ecuador om daar te werken aan hun droom; deze moeders te steunen met het opbouwen van een leven waar ze trots op kunnen zijn.

Niños de Waita Ticca

De naam van de stichting betekent zoveel als: ""Kinderen van de Heilige bloem/veer"". In de oudheid offerden de originele bewoners van Zuid-Amerika bloemen en veren om de Goden te vragen om ontwikkeling, geluk en wedergeboorte. De naam van de stichting symboliseert daarmee precies wat zij voor deze mensen wensen.

De stichting heeft als doel het stimuleren van, en het bieden van een veilige plek aan kansarme kinderen in de leeftijd van 0 tot 12 jaar.
Dit betekent gezonde voeding, scholing, medische verzorging en psychologische zorg.

“Onze kinderen”

Ecuador is het armste land van Zuid Amerika. In hartje Quito, de hoofdstad van Ecuador, worden sinds het voorjaar van 2004 vele kinderen opgevangen en begeleid in Villa Ticca. Momenteel in totaal 100 kinderen. Ondertussen is er ook een 2e opvang in het indianen dorpje Peguche geopend, waar nog eens 20 kinderen worden opgevangen.
Nieuw aangemelde kinderen worden van tevoren thuis bezocht door één van de medewerkers om een inschatting te kunnen maken van hun [vaak erbarmelijke]  leefomstandigheden. Op basis van dit bezoek wordt bepaald of de kinderen in aanmerking komen voor een plekje in Villa Ticca.
		
De kinderen krijgen gratis opvang tot op het moment dat hun verzorgers/ouder[s] inkomsten hebben. Is dit het geval dan wordt van hen een bijdrage verwacht. Hierdoor blijft de verantwoordelijkheid bij de verzorgers/ouder[s] liggen. Om te helpen de leefomstandigheden van de gezinnen te verbeteren zijn er regelmatig cursussen voor de verzorgers/ouder[s] Op dit moment wordt er een traject opgestart voor de moeders in Peguche omdat ze vaak niet kunnen lezen en schrijven. Door het aanpakken van het analfabetisme wordt geprobeerd deze gemeenschap betere kansen in de toekomst te geven.

Er is veel aandacht voor scholing. Zo krijgen de medewerkers van Villa Ticca een opleiding en/of bijscholing op kosten van de stichting. Daarnaast is er ook nog aandacht besteed aan het ontwikkelen van een leerplan. Het gehele pakket bestaat uit een jaarplanning die verdeeld is over 11 thema’s. Elk thema heeft een kist met bijbehorende materialen en een map met didactische werkbladen, kleurplaten en knutselideeën. Het onderwijs is op deze manier gegarandeerd!","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting KVK 32095199","info@villaticca.com","ABN AMRO","591052024","NL32ABNA0591052024","ABNANL2A","Niños de Waita Ticca","Snelhorstweg 1","Netherlands","727","2010-10-18","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

WorldGranny draagt bij aan de verbetering van de leefsituatie van ouderen, hun families en hun gemeenschappen in ontwikkelingslanden. In Nederland werkt WorldGranny aan bewustwording omtrent de situatie van ouderen in ontwikkelingslanden en werft zij fondsen voor het ondersteunen van projecten in deze landen. WorldGranny is in Nederland de enige organisatie die zich bezighoudt met ouderen en hun familie wereldwijd en is daarmee een vernieuwend initiatief te noemen. 

De stichting is in 2004 opgericht door drc. Caroline van Dullemen. Als journalist reisde zij veel door Afrika en sprak ze regelmatig met oudere vrouwen. Veel van deze vrouwen waren volledig op zichzelf aangewezen en hadden daar bovenop vaak ook nog de zorg voor hun kleinkinderen van wie de ouders waren vertrokken of, zoals vooral in zuidelijk Afrika, waren bezweken aan AIDS. Caroline realiseerde zich dat er ingrijpende politieke en economische veranderingen moeten plaatsvinden om de Afrikaanse bevolking een betere toekomst te kunnen bieden. Tegelijkertijd zag ze dat als deze meestal energieke ouderen een steuntje in de rug krijgen, hun omgeving daar direct van zou profiteren. Het bleek echter dat in Nederland nagenoeg geen aandacht was voor dit onderwerp. Dit is waarom zij WorldGranny heeft opgericht. De organisatie is in de afgelopen zes jaar uitgegroeid tot een organisatie die projecten ondersteunt in Afrikaanse, Aziatische en Latijns-Amerikaanse landen.

Sinds 1987 waren de oprichters: de voorzitter Dorine van den Berg en haar man Jan van den Berg, toenmalig huisarts in Ede, uitermate succesvol met het opzetten van medische en sociale projecten in Indonesië zoals het bouwen en inrichten van een nieuw ziekenhuis, dialyseklinieken, bloedbank, bejaardentehuis uitvoeren van wetenschappelijk onderzoek op het gebied van Hepatitis-B en HIV-Aids bestrijding, cataractoperaties en de zorg voor kinderen. De begeleiding van de vele achtergestelde kinderen in nood noopte tot verzelfstandiging in 2000. De stichting is toen opgericht door Dorine van den Berg-Burnaby Lautier, voormalig verpleegkundige. Jan van den Berg heeft in 2003 zijn huisartsenpraktijk neergelegd om zich samen met zijn echtgenote geheel in te zetten voor het welzijn van kinderen in Indonesië. De stichting is aangesloten bij het ISF, heeft het Anbi keur en het keurmerk Goede Doelen.
 
Sinds 1987 zijn diverse bestuursleden van de stichting betrokken bij het opzetten en begeleiden van financiële adoptieprojecten voor straatkinderen en andere achtergestelde kinderen in Indonesië om hen toegang te verstrekken tot het volgen van onderwijs en beroepstraining. De stichting is actief bij het financieren en begeleiden van het onderwijs van 800-850 kinderen per jaar. Daarnaast opvang van straatkinderen, begeleiden van meer dan 100 trafficking slachtoffers per jaar en de opvang, begeleiding en de verbetering van de rechten van kinderen in de gevangenis op het eiland Batam. Ook bij natuurrampen is het bestuur actief met het opzetten van speciale projecten voor kinderen in de getroffen gebieden.
De Stichting heeft in Nederland een bestuur van 5 vrijwilligers en een 1/2fte secretaresse. In Indonesië worden de projecten uitgevoerd door een door de stichting zelf opgezette partner met een Nederlandse projectmanager en een bestuur van ervaren Indonesische sociaal werkers. 
De Indonesische dochterorganisatie staat onder leiding van een Nederlandse Verpleegkundige die in het verleden hoofd was van de straatkinderenprojecten en het wetenschappelijk onderzoek heeft gecoördineerd. Zij zijn rechtstreeks verantwoording verschuldigd aan het bestuur en voeren alleen projecten uit die door beide partijen zijn goedgekeurd.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting KVK 09112835","jan@anak-asuh.nl","ING","P6799","NL06INGB0000006799","INGBNL2A","Stichting Anak Asuh Batam","MOLENSTRAAT","Netherlands","367","2009-12-27","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Stichting Ministries Argentinas is opgericht in 2005 als kleine vrijwilligersorganisatie.
De stichting heeft als doelstelling om bekendheid te geven aan en ondersteuning te bieden bij de armoedeproblematiek in de sloppenwijk Nuevo Golf, in de stad Mar del Plata te Argentinië.

Missie
De stichting wil de armste gezinnen in de wijk ondersteunen in hun ontwikkeling door middel van een integrale aanpak, gestoeld op vier pijlers, te weten educatieve ontwikkeling, werkgelegenheid, sport en voedselvoorziening. Deze aanpak is samengevat is Project 4,

Visie
Stichting Ministries Argentinas wil als kleinschalige vrijwilligersorganisatie een duidelijke rol spelen in de ontwikkeling van met name kinderen, jongeren en jonge gezinnen uit de
sloppenwijk Nuevo Golf, in de stad Mar del Plata te Argentinië. Na het voltooien van de startfasevan Project 4 is het de bedoeling dat de lokale organisatie zichzelf staande kan houden. De rol van Stichting Ministries Argentinas wordt in de toekomst dan ook meer ondersteunend en adviserend.

Ook omdat hij wilde bewijzen dat het behalen van resultaten met een sociaal project in het buitenland niet persé afhankelijk was van een traditionele Nederlandse stichting met veel betaalde medewerkers. Maar dat men door het inschakelen van gedreven (voetbal)vrijwilligers de wereld kon veranderen, en ook transparante en duurzame resultaten kon behalen.
 
De Stichting Stars in their Eyes is in 2006 in Nederland opgericht, in 2008 gevolgd door de Stars in their Eyes Foundation in Zuid-Afrika. Beide door Jooste opgericht. In Nederland bestaat de Stichting zuiver uit vrijwilligers – beide in het bestuur en in het trainerscorps. De Nederlandse organisatie is vooral actief met het creëren van twinningsverbanden tussen Nederlandse voetbalclubs en Zuid-Afrikaanse achterstandswijken. 'Stars in their Eyes’ is daardoor uniek, duurzaam, positief en direct.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting - Kamer van Koophandel Rotterdam 24400858","nic@coolfresh.nl","","225323567","","","Stichting Stars in their Eyes","","None","304","2009-10-20","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

When community members started to notice that erosion had its negative effects on the rivers flowing through their area several villagers decided to make a switch to ecotourism to preserve the National Park for future generations. In 2001 Lembaga Pariwisata Tangkahan (LPT / Tangkahan Tourism Foundation) became a fact. Accordingly, Fauna & Flora International (FFI) became active in the area. They formed the Community Response Unit (CRU) and 7 Sumatran elephants were brought to Tangkahan from Aceh. The elephants form the biggest and most important ecotourism attraction at the moment for both National and International visitors. Guests can go elephant trekking through the rainforests or help the mahouts giving the elephants a bath in the river.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:54:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","/","evagies@gmail.com","/","/","","","Tangkahan Tourism Foundation (LPT)","/","Indonesia","742","2010-10-25","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

In juli 2009 is een groep vrijwilligers uit Nederland, een maand naar Malawi geweest om daar op de Nanthomba basisschool te werken. Deze School is een van de eerste gerealiseerde projecten van “H.E.L.P. Malawi Children”.

Hierna is deze groep de gemeenschap en de stichting blijven steunen door fondswerving voor verschillende projecten en door zelf projecten, zoals bijv. studiebeurzen voor het voortgezet onderwijs, op te zetten. Voortvloeiend hieruit is de stichting H.E.L.P. Malawi Nederland opgericht om zo beter en meer gestructureerd hulp te kunnen bieden op lange termijn. 

In augustus 2011 gaan Brechje Swart en Roelof Veldhuizen, oprichters van de stichting, weer terug naar Malawi om een jaar lang ontwikkelingswerk te doen in samen werking met “H.E.L.P.

Op langere termijn het uitbereiden van deze organisatie in andere Europese landen.

Zoals eerder aangekondigd heeft Jongeren Organisatie Khorasan maar één doel; het koesteren en het behartigen van belangen van de Afghaanse jongeren in Nederland. Afghaanse jongeren hebben het zwaar. Naast het gebrek aan kennis over hoe de Nederlandse samenleving en voornamelijk het onderwijssysteem, sociale structuren en het politieke systeem werken, worden ze ook geconfronteerd met twee verschillende culturen, normen en waarden, namelijk het Afghaanse achtergrond en de Nederlandse cultuur waarin ze leven. Net als alle andere nieuwe Nederlanders hebbende Afghaanse jongeren dagelijks met twee milieus te maken. Jongeren Organisatie Khorasan dat, door en voor jongeren opgericht is, wil graag een bijdrage leveren in de zoektocht naar een gemeenschappelijke identiteit en een evenwicht tussen de twee culturen. Hieronder een overzicht van onze doelstelling, waarna voor elke punt een uitgebreide uiteenzetting:

Noah works on franchising community-based models of care where motivated individuals from communities are guided to form their own circle of support which is referred to as an Ark. Rather than being limited to a physical structure, an Ark is a network of accountable and synergistic people armed with the skills and confidence to care for its OVC.

Noah‟s model is one that starts with an approach by a community to Noah to assist them to care for their OVC. Noah assists in the formation of a committee of community leaders to focus on the children. They are trained in the needs of children and in turn recruit a volunteer group who are trained and then register OVC in their community. Volunteers continually monitor the circumstances of the children and refer them to the appropriate agency as needed. The final pillar of an Ark is a dedicated resource centre from which programmes and services are rolled out.

We offer day and after care as well as feeding schemes in all 101 Arks. The programmes have a holistic approach to ensure that the children grow up to be confident and whole individuals with bright futures regardless of the circumstances they are born into.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:59.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered Section 21 NPO No. 2002/021668/08

De stichting is ontstaan als reactie op vragen uit Bangladesh om samen te werken aan kleinschalige ontwikkelingsprojecten. Twee van de drie stichters hebben geruime tijd in Bangladesh gewerkt. We werken samen met vrienden die we daar hebben ontmoet, en die willen werken aan verbeteringen in hun omgeving. Voor het gezondheidsonderwijs project zijn dat Sumita en Ainun Nahar. Catharien en Sumita kennen elkaar sinds 1993, toen ze samen veldwerk deden, en interviews bij heel arme vrouwen deden. Het contact is altijd gebleven. Ainun Nahar is een vriendin van Sumita. Ze werken al heel lang samen. Als freelance trainers hebben ze geen vaste inkomsten. Ze hebben wel beide een passie voor bewustwording bij meisjes, en zijn met het idee dat meisjes meer moeten weten over hygiene aan de slag gegaan. Ze hebben in 2008 een lespakket ontwikkeld, wat heel simpel begint (was je handen) en in de loop van de tijd lastiger zaken aan de orde stelt (HIV/AIDS, drugs, mensensmokkel, ongewenste intimiteiten, en hygiene rondom menstruatie). Ze hebben contacten gelegd met scholen en gevraagd of ze deze lessen mogen geven. De scholen waren eerst aarzelend, maar zijn nu erg enthousiast. Er is 1 school afgehaakt, daar was het onderwerp toch te gevoelig/lastig te bespreken. Er zijn nu meer scholen die ook mee willen doen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:05.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, Algemeen nut beogende instelling, KvK nr 09175879","batashi@mail.com","","139449833","","","Stichting Batashi","","Netherlands","73","2008-08-22","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Door de samenwerking met de Wilde Ganzen gaat van iedere gedoneerde euro er maar liefst 1,55 euro naar onze projecten.

De stichting staat voor het ondersteunen, creëren en uitvoeren van ontwikkelingsprojecten met betrekking tot onderwijs en gezondheidspreventie in Zuid Amerika. Voorlichting in Nederland is hiervan een integraal onderdeel.

De stichting is opgericht in december 2009. Het e-voorlichting project in Uruguay is dan ook het eerste project wat de stichting zal opzetten en uitvoeren. Het plan voor het project is ontstaan na een stage van Mark gedurende drie maanden bij een bedrijf in Montevideo (EviMed). Voor dit bedrijf voerde hij veel interviews uit met artsen in het land. Samen met een collega liep hij mee met een arts in een ruraal gebied in de provincie Salto. Een van de erkende problemen is gezondheidsvoorlichting aan geisoleerde scholen. Er is vaak een gebrek aan educatief materiaal en leraren zijn niet voldoende geschoold. Daarom speelt de doktor een belangrijke rol om voorlichting te geven.

Vanuit die ervaringen zijn ideeën ontstaan die aansluiten op een reeds lopend nationaal project “Plan Ceibal” (www.laptop.org en www.ceibal.edu.uy). Door dit project hebben nu 400.000 kinderen de beschikking over een laptop.Via EviMed zijn we in contact gekomen met onze huidige partnerorganisatie, Educate Uruguay, waarmee we verder gingen brainstormen en terecht kwamen op het huidige idee. Stichting Movimiento en Educate Uruguay zullen hun complementaire kennis inzetten om gedurende een jaar een eerste versie van een digitaal educatief platform te ontwerpen, realiseren en implementeren op drie plattelandsschooltjes.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:36.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

In 2005 waren Henny en Jaap Matser op bezoek bij een vriendin, die als vrijwilligster een jaar lang in een weeshuis in Offinso, Ghana, werkte. Daar kwamen zij in contact met  de Ghanese vrijwilligster  Margaret Adutwumwaa. Zij vroeg gemotiveerd om raad en hulp voor het opzetten van een ( dag-)opvang voor  kwetsbare kinderen met een verstandelijke of meervoudige beperking.

Bij de organisatie werken drie vrijwillige bestuursleden; Henny Matser als administrateur en allround vrijwilliger; diverse assisterende vrijwilligers uit gezin/familie en vriendenkring; een zich langzaam maar zeker uitbreidend netwerk van ( actieve ) Vrienden en ( in het project in Ghana gewerkt hebbende en/of nog regelmatig het project bezoekende ) vrijwilligers uit Nederland/België/Duitsland/Zweden.

Voorbeelden van gerealiseerde projecten:
1.	24-uurs opvang voor 10 gehandicapte kinderen in een oud huurhuis van Kings and Queens
2.	Volledige financiering van 95% van alle kosten van deze opvang
3.	Huis voorzien van meubilair, kleinere aanpassingen in en aan dit huis, educatief speelmateriaal ; en electra
4.	Kinderen voorzien van kleding
5.	Bouw en inrichting van een kleine Korenmolen naast het huis ( door diefstal van electro-motor even buiten gebruik ) ( gaat tzt mee naar de zorgboerderij ).
6.	Werving en begeleiding van vrijwilligers vanuit Nederland naar Kings and Queens; verwerven van vrijwillige, deskundige professoionals
7.	Advisering van Bestuur en medewerkers van Kings and Queens op allerlei gebied ( inhoud van zorg; hygiëne; educatie; beheer; bouw; fondsenwerving in Ghana etc.).
8.	Ondersteuning van een HBO-student, die in weeshuis in Offinso woont en ook vrijwillig in project werkt.
9.	Eenmalige advisering van een ander Nederlands initiatief in Tamale ( Noord-Ghana) :  Kassim project ).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:33.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Sanouna is een klein vissersdorp aan de Bani rivier in centraal Mali. Zo’n vijftig gezinnen leven hier in rieten hutten aan het water. Elke dag hebben de moeders moeite om voldoende eten op tafel te zettten. De kinderen hebben weinig uitzicht op het doorbreken van de vicieuze cirkel van armoede, gebrek aan onderwijs en slechte gezondheid. Door overbevissing en de bouw van een dam zijn de vooruitzichten slecht.

Zij krijgen direct ook een baan aangeboden bij het Nairobi Community Media House, dat zeer uiteenlopende en verrassende reportages maakt vanuit de sloppenwijk. Professionals van Nederlandse media bedrijven begeleiden de reporters. 

De jonge bewoners van de Keniase sloppenwijken krijgen zo niet alleen de kans op een beter bestaan voor zichzelf en hun gezin, zij kregen ook de gelegenheid een stem te geven aan hun (veelal onzichtbare) community. 

De ‘African Slum Journals’ vanuit de sloppenwijken worden gepubliceerd op www.africanslumjournal.com. Verrassende tweewekelijkse video afleveringen over het leven van mensen in sloppenwijken, met uiteenlopende thema’s als alcoholgebruik, carrières, hygiëne, koken, haarstijlen en mode. 

Versterking van de media in Afrika geeft slumbewoners de kans hun kwesties naar buiten te brengen op lokaal, nationaal en internationaal niveau. Mensen over de hele wereld krijgen zo een kijkje in de keuken van het echte leven in de sloppenwijk. Een leven dat niet slechts over kommer en kwel gaat, maar vooral over het omarmen van kansen. 

In de afgelopen jaren heeft de stichting veel mobiele reporters opgeleid in zeven Afrikaanse landen. Jonge afrikanen krijgen equipment en coaching, en publiceren hun reports op de website www.voicesofafrica.com.

Voices in Africa Media Foundation in Nederland is verantwoordelijk voor fundraising, coördinatie en coaching van de projecten in Afrika. Het team wordt ondersteund door vrijwilligers, en gecontroleerd door een Raad van Toezicht.

Wij zijn allemaal afkomstig uit Bosnië en gaan er regelmatig naar toe. Zo kwamen wij in contact met allerlei kinderen waarbij zelfs niet in de basisbehoeften,  zoals eten, warme kleren, schoolboeken etc, was voorzien. Wij hebben besloten ons hier voor in te zetten. Een tijdje hebben wij kinderen individueel geholpen door geld te geven buskaarten, schoolboeken of kleding uit Nederland.  Door het oprichten van de stichting (2008) dachten wij nog meer kinderen te kunnen helpen.  
Voor Spero werken er 3 mensen die hem opgericht hebben. Voor verschillende ""klusjes"" of projecten hebben wij vrijwilligers hier in Nederland.

In Bosnië hebben wij mensen die contact onderhouden met de kinderen, scholen en ander instanties (gemeente). Zij gaan naar de kinderen toe en bekijken hun situatie. Ook verzamelen zij informatie voor ons en begeleiden projecten in Bosnië. 
Spero heeft in 2008 een grote kapotgeschoten basisschool in het oosten van Bosnië - gemeente Foca, plaats Popov Most, opgeknapt. 
Dit jaar gaan wij met Nederlandse studenten van de NHTV school in Breda naar Nova Bila (gemeente Travnik) om daar een vervallen school op te knappen. Deze reis gaat in totaal 9 dagen duren. Studenten gaat klassen schilderen, vloer leggen en een hek rondom de vervallen en onveilige schoolplein plaatsen.

De slogan van de stichting is dan ook: “Geven om en geven aan kinderen in Oeganda”

De stichting zet zich in voor kinderen in Oeganda ongeacht afkomst of religie. De bedoeling is niet alleen om ""vissen te vangen vóór deze arme kinderen, maar ze materiaal te geven om zélf te leren vissen!""

De stichting werkt uitsluitend met vrijwilligers, mensen die zich in hun vrije tijd op enthousiaste wijze inzetten om de gestelde doelen te verwezenlijken. Op deze wijze wordt op een verantwoorde wijze omgegaan met de verkregen sponsorgelden en wordt een maximaal rendement bereikt. Momenteel bestaat onze stichting in Nederland uit 11 leden en komen wij 3-wekelijks bij elkaar voor een vergadering.

In Februari 2004 is onze stichting opgericht door voorzitter Cor van der Neut. Cor was vanwege het 125-jarig bestaan van het schoolbestuur waar hij voor werkt
naar Oeganda gestuurd om een film te maken over Onderwijs in Oeganda. Terug in Nederland besloot Cor dat hij meer met zijn ervaringen moest doen dan alleen een film
maken en zijn verhaal op school te vertellen. Hij besloot de stichting ""Kinderen van Oeganda"" op te richten. Deze naam bleek echter al in gebruik en zo werd de stichting omgedoopt tot Uganda Child Care Foundation. Het eerste project van de stichting was het naar Nederland halen van het weeskinderkoor ""Mwangaza"" van een lokale partner (ARM) die Cor in Oeganda had ontmoet.

 
In 2004 kwam dit weeskinderkoor naar Nederland. De komst van dit koor werd betaald van het vakantiegeld van de leden van de stichting.
Na 4 weken touren in Dordrecht e.o had het kinderkoor genoeg geld opgehaald om een kleuterschool in een buitenwijk te bouwen en te starten.
 
in 2007 heeft dit koor 4 weken in Dordrecht e.o en 2 weken in de Achterhoek opgetreden. Resultaat van deze tour was 120 kinderen gesponsord,een school in Ggaba en een motorfiets voor een sociaal werker.
 
Momenteel zijn wij druk bezig met een tour te organiseren die plaats zal gaan vinden in sept/okt 2010 en waar Mwangaza Dordrecht,de Achterhoek en Zuid-limburg zal gaan aandoen.

In Oeganda werken wij samen met 2 lokale parters:
- Africa Renewal Ministries (ARM)
- Celebrate Hope Ministries (CHM)
 
De rolverdeling tussen het UCCF tov deze Oegandeese partners is als volgt:
-Het UCCF werft fondsen.
-Gezamelijk worden projecten/programma's bedacht en ontwikkeld ,de wens van de lokale partner is hierbij zeer belangrijk.
-De lokale partners voeren het project.
-De lokale partner brengt verslagen over de projecten uit aan het UCCF.
-De lokale partner beheert het project na afronding
-De UCCF adviseerd de lokale partner waar nodig bij het beheren van het project.
 
Inmiddels hebben wij al een aantal projecten als stichting weten af te ronden. waar wij als stichting ook erg trots op zijn.
 
Afgeronde projecten samen met Africa Renewal Ministries:
-opbouwen en starten van een kleuterschool in een buitenwijk van Kampala
-het bouwen van een keuken bij deze kleuterschool
-het inrichten van een nieuw ziekenhuis in GGaba een dorpje buiten Kampala
-het sturen van 2 containers met educatief materiaal naar Oeganda.

Jongeren in deze rurale gebieden hebben na het gratis reguliere onderwijs, vaak niet de middelen verder te studeren. Daarnaast hebben ze door hun gebrek aan praktische kennis weinig kans op een baan. 

In 2006 kwam het Lideke Wery Educational Institute tot stand. Het LWEI biedt kansarme jongeren in de (rurale) omgeving van Induruwa, aan de westkust van Sri Lanka, cursussen Engels en ICT aan voor een lage lesprijs. De jongeren vergroten hiermee hun kans op een baan of toelating tot een vervolgopleiding.

Er werken 9 mensen voor het LWEI. Twee Engelse leraressen, twee IT leraren, een caretaker en  een administratrice (allen Sri Lankanen). Verder bestaat het managementteam uit een Sri Lankaans schoolhoofd, een Nederlandse project manager en een Nederlandse project coordinator.

PME is een resort dat gericht is op avonturiers-tourisme. In opdracht van gemeenteraadslid én advocaat Mr. Ferdinand Marcus M. Bañosia heb ik dit project in de functie van projectontwikkelaar ontwikkeld en uitgevoerd. Voor deze werkzaamheden krijg ik een percentage van de inkomsten. In de basis staat dit project los van MCF. Echter, mijn bedoeling is om “mijn” revenuen uit dit project te herinvesteren in MCF. Wegens een gebrek aan touristen, als gevolg van de huidige financiële crisis, is PME nog niet operationeel en is er van enige betaling dus nog geen sprake.

Daar er bij de opzet van MCF wordt uitgegaan van een coöperatieve boerderij, is er van een eigenaar geen sprake. Van de “boeren” uit Maygatasan die hun activiteiten wegens geldgebrek hebben moeten staken, wordt de landbouwgrond overgenomen door MCF en verworden deze tot bestuurders. Als initieel voorzitter zal op gaan treden Mevr. G. Yuson, woonachtig in Maygatasan. Andere leden uit de bevolkingingsgroep van Maygatasan zullen deel gaan nemen in de vorm van arbeidskrachten voor de bewerking van de landbouwgrond.

Wanneer het volledig benodigde bedrag is verzameld, ga ikzelf terug naar Maygatasan om het project te gaan leiden in de functie van bestuursvoorzitter.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:00.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Natuurlijk persoon","martin@pina-experience.ph","","526081392","","","Martin Machielsen","","None","231","2009-01-10","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Stichting IBO-Nederland ondersteunt lokale ontwikkelingsprojecten voor mensen die hulp behoeven, ongeacht hun godsdienst, wereldbeschouwing of nationaliteit. Jaarlijks zendt IBO-Nederland tientallen vrijwilligers uit, die zich gedurende enkele weken belangeloos inzetten voor het goede doel. Deze medewerking wordt opgevat als een uiting van menselijke solidariteit, als een bijdrage tot verbetering van de internationale betrekkingen en als middel tot geestelijke verrijking van hen die hier actief en/of passief bij betrokken worden.

Missie
Door vrijwilligers uit te zenden naar hulpprojecten in het buitenland en nauwe samenwerking met de plaatselijke bevolking te bevorderen, wil IBO-Nederland een concrete bijdrage leveren aan lokale initiatieven, onderlinge solidariteit, inzicht in andere denkwijzen/culturen en aan maatschappelijke bewustwording in het algemeen.
 
Sinds 1953 actief
De Internationale Bouworde heeft sinds haar ontstaan in 1953 aan meer dan 5.500 ontwikkelings- projecten hulp geboden. Deze projecten variëren van de bouw en renovatie van weeshuizen, woningen, kinderdorpen, ziekenhuizen, kerken, sociale centra, enzovoorts.

Our target groups are orphans and vulnerable children, underprivileged women, youths, small scale farmers and the HIV infected. Our aim is to help these groups in such a way that they eventually can sustain themselves. We want to achieve this by reducing illiteracy, poverty and HIV/Aids through programs aimed at improving the levels of literacy and economic emancipation.

The organization was started in 2001 out of an outcry for rural community development by the traditional chiefs and the rural people who were not supported by any development programs from both public and civil society institutions .A few individuals headed by Getrude Soko took up the challenge and started mobilizing communities for education, health and social change in the far off areas of Petauke .It was then discovered that people lacked all the basic facilities.   Intervention areas were identified as education, health, food security and poverty reduction. In the years that followed community schools were established as well as farmer groups, widows groups, women clubs, youth clubs and women co-operative societies run by the communities with the technical support from Titukuke

The Titukuke organization has an office in Petauke Boma which is headed by the Executive Director who is appointed by the Board and supported by the program coordinator, bookkeeper, secretary, field manager and other workers in the catchment areas. All staff members are volunteers.

We operate in six chiefdoms, Nyanje, Mumbi , Sandwe, Nyamphande, Mwanjawantha and Kalindawalo. In total we work with and support
•	25 community schools
•	35 women’s groups
•	10 farmer groups
•	40 youth groups
•	1 women’s cooperative society
•	12  support groups for people living with HIV/Aids
•	12 home based care giver groups
•	12 widow clubs
•	3 bee keepers groups

As far as education is concerned finished projects include small and simple community schools in 25 villages in the rural areas. A latrine block on the plot where the new school will be and supplying community schools with school materials.
In other areas we conducted programs on the prevention of HIV/Aids, Voluntary counseling and testing programs and mobilization programs for people living with HIV/Aids.

This specific project is part of the bigger project of constructing a new school which will be funded by our Dutch partner. The school needs furniture and books and manuals. We are currently raising funds for the furniture. With the current project we hope to find money to buy schoolbooks and teacher manuals for the pupils in grade 1 and 2.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:54:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered as a non profit  Community Based Organisation under the Society’s Act Regisstration number ORS/102/20/196 March 23rd ,2005.","titukuke@yahoo.com","","104240202","","","Titukuke Rural Community Development Association","","Netherlands","420","2010-03-11","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

That is why he founded Vital Actions for Sustainable Development, a youth green NGO. 

The organization headquarters are in the French Embassy Street, 2nd floor, PO Box: 20.387, in Yaoundé Cameroon. The aim is to promote eco-citizenship among people in Cameroon in order to bring each citizen to become an eco-citizen in his daily activities. The NGO works very closely with the UNFCCC and IPCC Focal Points in Cameroon in order to include youth contributions in these processes. These partners will assist the organization with trainings skills and project management during this project to empower volunteers. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty produced at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a scientific intergovernmental body tasked with evaluating the risk of climate change caused by human activity established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

Ten young people are active within the Vital Actions for Sustainable Development as the permanent unpaid staff. More than twenty volunteers are also involved temporary. They are students and young professionals and organize sensitization's activities and trainings to empower youth and children to tackle global warming starting from the little things and are also involved with the Youth Network for Central African Forests in the ''Our Forests are Our Future'' project aiming to mobilize more than 10.000 youth around the safeguard of the Congo Basin's forests in order to help African countries with adaption in a changing climate.  The NGO is not receiving sustainable funds from donor or other organizations. To ensure that some funds are available during the field work the staff is planing to start to implement some some income generating activities and projects in the coming years.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:30.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","The organization through this registration is recognized as a non-profit Non Governmental Organization (NGO).

It was established by a group of prominent Acehnese leaders and foreign activists and specialists in 1997. As Aceh carries a long history, so does the board of founders. 
With current founders in place, local trust and support is secured in the region; the former governor of Aceh, former regent of Aceh Jaya, former members of Indonesian parliament and regional parliaments and several professors of the University Syiah Kuala in Banda Aceh, are all members of Yayasan Pulau Banyak. The activities are managed in the field by trained and experienced local islanders and Acehnese, supervised and managed by Maggie Muurmans, a Dutch sea turtle expert with extensive experience in Latin America and Indonesia, and Mahmud Bangkaru, a Swedish eco-tourism expert with a long history in Aceh and well trusted by the local communities in Pulau Banyak. The field staff consists of permanently employed staff, including university graduates, and both domestic and international volunteers. Our staff policy is to employ locals where possible and increase the number of women employed, both as managers and as field staff. 
 Yayasan Pulau Banyak has established itself over many years as an organisation accepted and trusted by the local community and supported by a wide spectrum of respected and trusted political leaders in Aceh. Yayasan Pulau Banyak is also entrusted by the Indonesian government’s Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam (BKSDA-NAD) to manage the conservation efforts in Pulau Banyak. As a local NGO the community is proud to be part of all its efforts and activities and sees the organisation as “theirs”. 
Being a local organisation run by partly local people, traditions and cultures are being respected. All the above will positively affect the ability of the organisation to achieve proposed mission and objectives.
Some recent completed projects:
- Waste management assessment in the archipelago
- English teaching on all local schools and for local community members
- First aid course for staff and members of workgroups living on islands without access to docters/nurses
- Training course for all local teachers on how to deliver environmental education programmes
- Protection of the nesting beach of 3 species of (critically endangered) sea turtles
- Set up of eco-tourism programme by providing equipment and training

The organisation has 16 staff, all from the islands or Aceh. The only two foreigners active in the organisation is Mahmud Bangkaru (Sweden) and Maggie Muurmans (Dutch) who assist in the running of the programmes. International volunteers visit the project on and off with an average of 2 volunteers per month. Previous volunteers have assisted in teaching English and patrolling the beach to collect data on the nesting sea turtles. The strength of Yayasan Pulau Banyak is that we are very localised. In this way we have a strong support network and the local community sees the organisation as one of their own. Expanding to other areas in Indonesia would spread us thin.  We have completed the waste management assessement and methods of transporting, recycling or storing the waste have been carried forward. The certified first aid training sessions have been conducted in several villages for mainly staff and prominent community members. This has helped to them to make risk assessments and take precautionary measures. The training will be refreshed every year.
Teachers on the environmental training programme have received a certificate from the education board (government body) and our organisation. The training ran for 2 weeks in the field and 1 week theory.
Population numbers for turtles are not certain yet. As turtles need to be monitored and tagged for a minimum of 3 years to be able to estimate the population size, we have not been able to do so yet as the tagging programme has only been running for 2.5 years. (nesting intervals for greens and leatherbacks are 2-3 years). We do know that we are dealing with a medium size rookery and a very important nesting beach for Sumatra for the green and leatherback turtle.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Foundation

De activiteiten concentreren zich op het eiland Pulau Banyak, een archipel voor de kust in het zuidoosten van Aceh, dat in het noorden van het Indonesische Sumatra  ligt. De eilanden zijn tropisch en bestaan uit mangroven, regenwoud, moerassen en worden omringd door prachtige koraalriffen. Vooral de groene schildpad, de lederrug schildpad en de haviksbek schildpad nesten hier. 

    

Door de burgeroorlog stopte de activiteiten in 2001. In 2006 startte de Nederlandse schildpaddenexpert Maggie Muurmans het project weer op. Het onbewoonde eiland Bangkaru is met 1.900 schildpadnesten per jaar een belangrijke nestlocatie in de wereld. Inmiddels bestaat het team uit voornamelijk lokale medewerkers die op het strand patrouilleren, research verrichten, voorlichting geven over de schildpad en het ecotoerisme verzorgen. Het project stimuleert duurzame economische ontwikkeling van de lokale bevolking en verzorgd educatie over het belang van natuurbescherming. In maart 2009 ontving Maggie voor haar werk voor het project de prestigieuze Future For Nature Award uit handen van natuurfilmer David Attenbourough.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting","pulaubanyak@gmail.com","","400614170","","","Yayasan Pulau Banyak","","None","279","2009-10-01","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Het project is in 2008 gestart, onder de naam Christian Vision Uganda, met de bouw van een Trainingscentrum. De projectleider is Jackson Kasozi. Vanaf 2011 is de naam Matendo actief geworden. Deze naam is een paraplu voor alle ontwikkelingsactiviteiten die in en rondom het Matendo vocational trainingcentre plaatsvinden. 

Het beroepstrainingscentrum biedt jongeren een kans bieden om praktische beroepsvaardigheden aan te leren om zodoende te kunnen voorzien in hun eigen levensonderhoud. De trainingen worden eind 2013 gestart.

De begeleidingscommissie van Matendo in Uganda bestaat uit 8 personen. De commissie is verantwoordelijk voor de beleidsontwikkeling en begeleiding van de verschillende projecten, zoals de beroepstrainingen, voorlichting over hiv / aids, watervoorziening.

De aanleiding voor het oprichten van Matendo was de toename van het aantal weeskinderen, ten gevolge van hiv/aids, in de regio Kibaale en de slechte omstandigheden omtrent de watervoorziening. Er zijn steeds meer jongeren die geen mogelijkheid hebben om voortgezet onderwijs te volgen. 

In 2011 is in Nederland de stichting Matendo opgericht.

Daar zagen zij hoe de Guatemalteekse bevolking in grote armoede leefde. Ze waren verbaasd over het feit dat slechts een kleine percentage van de kinderen naar school ging. In april 2006 deed één van hen via het internet een oproep aan vrienden en familie om geld te geven aan de school waarop hij werkte en zo de arme kinderen van de school te helpen. Zijn oproep werd massaal gehonoreerd en veel mensen gaven een donatie. In Guatemala zelf werden de mensen ook enthousiast over zijn initiatief en veel mensen boden hun hulp aan. Samen startten zij de organisatie, Niños de Guatemala. In Nederland richtten zij samen de stichting Niños de Guatemala Nederland op, om vanuit Nederland het werk van de Guatemalteekse NGO te ondersteunen.

De NDG is een organisatie die zich inzet voor een betere toekomst van Guatemalteekse kinderen en jongeren, daar waar dit het hardst nodig is. In Nederland werft NDG fondsen en donaties en in Guatemala ondersteunt NDG jongeren- en gemeenschapsprojecten.

De NDG heeft in Guatemala een Guatemalteekse NGO opgericht om het werk in Guatemala te coördineren. De NGO wordt gezamenlijk bestuurd door zowel Nederlandse vrijwilligers vanuit Nederland die full-time in Guatemala zijn en Guatemalteken. De NGO is de eigenaar van alle bezittingen (zoals de school) en stuurt middels een dagelijks bestuur (executive board – met 4 leden) en een algemeen bestuur (met 5 leden) de organisatie aan. De operationele activiteiten van NDG spelen zich af in de school Nuestro Futuro in Ciudad Vieja en het NDG Volunteer Center (Centro de Voluntariados) in Antigua. De school Nuestro Futuro is het charitatieve project. Daarnaast is er het Centro de Voluntariodos. 

Om lokale betrokkenheid te vergroten wordt het meeste werk ter plaatse door Guatemalteken verricht onder begeleiding van de NGO. De idee is dat NDG de lokale organisatie professioneel begeleidt en ondersteunt, en dat de centrale rollen zoveel mogelijk door Guatemalteken zelf worden vervuld.  

De leerkrachten van de school komen allemaal uit Guatemala en zijn, omdat er in Guatemala een overschot is aan gediplomeerde leerkrachten, uit een grote groep geselecteerd. Zij worden op dit moment nog betaald door de NDG in Nederland, maar het is de bedoeling dat de school in vijf jaar volledig zelfstandig zal opereren.

De lokale overheid steunt de school met bv vergunningen, financiële hulp wordt echter niet geboden. Toch zijn de betrekkingen met de lokale gemeente erg goed en is financiële steun in de toekomst zeker niet uitgesloten.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:54.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting Niños de Guatemala Nederland

Dat doen wij door te investeren in kleinschalige en inkomsten genererende projecten zodat men vanuit eigen kracht een zelfstandig bestaan kan opbouwen. 
En door te investeren in training en vakmanschap, zodat straatjongeren en met name vrouwen in achtergestelde gebieden kennis opdoen en van daaruit meer kansen krijgen.
 
Ons Afri-can Bestuur en Team bestaat uit 12 enthousiaste vrijwilligers die allemaal hun eigen talent inzetten om zo een steentje bij te dragen.

In 2006 is Chantal Heutink als vrijwilligster voor 4 maanden in Kenia gaan werken. De kracht, de wil en de potentie van de mensen op het platteland heeft haar erg geraakt. De plannen en ideeën om de cirkel te doorbreken zijn er, alleen de kennis en het startkapitaal ontbreekt. Dat heeft haar ertoe aangezet om samen met haar man Paul Jaspers  Afri-can Foundation op te richten.  

Ondernemerschap maakt Afrika sterk. Daarom creeëren wij kansen voor lokale ondernemers. Ter plekke, in de dorpen, sámen met de gemeenschap. Omdat iedereen potentie heeft.

In Ethiopië werken we samen met het Tsedale Nega College. Alice O en Tsedale Nega in Gondar zijn gelijkwaardige partners in het project ""Gondar on the Move"". We werken gezamenlijk aan het realiseren van de doelstellingen van het project, waarbij Alice O de Nederlandse activiteiten en Tsedale Nega College de Ethiopische activiteiten coördineert.

Het project is geschreven door jongeren voor jongeren in Sierra Leone. 

Door middel van creatieve therapie wordt er gewerkt aan het verleden van de jongeren, wordt er aandacht besteed aan het heden en met een kritische blik gekeken naar de toekomst. 
Dit met als doel om de jongeren een groep te bieden waar ze over deze onderwerpen kunnen spreken, hun vaak heftige toekomst een plek te geven en positief naar de toekomst kunnen kijken. 

Alpha Kamara en Sanne Haanraads (ik) zijn de oprichters van dit project. Samen met Ibrahim Kamara en Aminata Bockarie hebben we het één ander uitgedacht in Sierra Leone. Alle jongeren werken vrijwillig aan dit project. Er is voor hen in Freetown geen werk op dit moment en toch willen ze graag iets doen. ""Beter vrijwillig iets nuttigs doen dan helemaal niks doen."" 
Terug in Nederland heb ik FYM samen met een klasgenoot Simone Bonfrer verder uitgewerkt. Twee andere klasgenoten hebben ons geholpen met hun kennis over drama en muziek therapie. 
Verder zijn er nog wat familieleden betrokken bij dit project als adviseurs.

FYM is opgericht naar aanleiding van mijn bezoek aan Sierra Leone (sep. 2009 - jan. 2010). Toen heb ik een milde vorm van beeldende therapie gegeven. Vanwege het enthousiasme van de deelnemers en de uitwerking die deze lessen op hen hadden zijn we gaan kijken of er een mogelijkheid was om hier meer mee te doen.

Summary of the organisation (English):
An organization founded by and focused on the youth in Sierra Leone. Working on motivating and supporting the youth to take an active part in improving the future of themselves and their community.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:06.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Vrijwilligersorganisatie / Youth organisation","liefsikke@hotmail.com","ASN Bank","707746418","NL69SNSB0707746418","SNSBNL2A","Free Your Mind","Antwoordnummer 1188, 2501 WB","Netherlands","738","2010-10-24","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

"001J000000sncWMIAY","false","","SCORE Zuid-Afrika","","","","Weerdsingel WZ 33a","Utrecht","","3513 BC","Netherlands","","","","","","0208910322","","","http://www.score.org.za","","","","","","","SCORE is een internationaal erkende sportontwikkelingsorganisatie die sport en spel inzet als middel voor ontwikkeling van individuen en gemeenschappen. SCORE is in 1991 opgericht door een voormalig Olympisch atlete als reactie op de kritieke toestand van jongeren in townships in Zuid-Afrika. Naast Zuid-Afrika is SCORE tegenwoordig ook werkzaam in Zambia, Namibië, Lesotho en Nederland. Momenteel werken er zo’n 50 betaalde mensen voor SCORE. SCORE zet op een duurzame wijze sport en spel activiteiten op en gebruikt sport om jongeren vaardigheden te laten ontwikkelen op het gebied van sport, management en levensvaardigheden. SCORE zorgt ervoor dat jongeren de kans krijgen om zich te ontwikkelen én een bijdrage kunnen leveren aan hun community. SCORE focust hierbij op leiderschap en rolmodellen, vrouwen en sport en HIV/AIDS preventie. Niet voor niets is de slogan van SCORE; ‘Changing Lives Through Sport’! 

Door middel van training op het gebied van leiderschap en levensvaardigheden, evenals door het vestigen van permanente en democratische organisatiestructuren en activiteiten op het gebied van sociale verandering, bewijst SCORE de kracht van sport als middel van ontwikkeling. Sport als middel is ook een belangrijke drijfveer van transformatie binnen een community; bijvoorbeeld in de vorm van het veranderen van negatieve stereotypes ten aanzien van geslacht, het bevorderen van sociale verantwoordelijkheid, het bestrijden van vooroordelen en het opheffen van discriminatie en culturele scheidslijnen.

Om zo goed mogelijk op de behoeften van een community (lokale gemeenschap) aan te sluiten, zijn er verschillende programma’s opgesteld. In al deze programma’s komen de volgende, voor SCORE belangrijkste onderdelen terug: 
-	Ontwikkeling van en door sport: het aangaan van langdurige samenwerkingsverbanden met communities en stakeholders om sport op te bouwen, te versterken en een permanente plaats te geven binnen de community;
-	Capaciteitsopbouw en capaciteitsversterking: het aanbieden van een scala aan vernieuwende en doeltreffende oplossingen op maat, op het gebied van capaciteitsopbouw en capaciteitsversterking van communities, maar ook van sportorganisaties, partners en andere spelers op het gebied van sport en ontwikkeling. 
-	Vrijwilligers en uitwisseling: het lokaal en internationaal werven van sportvrijwilligers en het plaatsen van deze vrijwilligers in communities waar ze wonen en werken. De vrijwilligers worden grondig voorbereid en getraind door SCORE, zodat hun bijdrage aan de projecten maximaal kan worden benut voor ontwikkelingsdoeleinden. Een belangrijk thema binnen het vrijwilligersbeleid is de interculturele uitwisseling.

SCORE werkt in  met een drietal programma’s: Living Sport, VIP en Cup of Heroes.
Living Sport
LivingSport is een van de belangrijkste programma’s, hierin worden communities in achtergestelde en stedelijke gebieden versterkt door sport in te zetten voor jeugdactiviteiten en als instrument voor individueel ‘empowerment’. Als onderdeel van LivingSport is de  SCORE Leadership Ladder ontwikkeld. De leadership ladder is een trainingscurriculum waarin sport, leiderschap en levensvaardigheden centraal staan. De deelnemers worden op deze belangrijke onderdelen geschoold, zodat zij de benodigde kennis, vaardigheden en zelfvertrouwen hebben om teams op te zetten en te begeleiden, alsook het opzetten en onderhouden van competities. De opgedane kennis wordt doorgegeven aan anderen binnen de community, waardoor een solide basis wordt gelegd voor de toekomst van deze activiteiten, teams en structuren in de community. 

VIP
Het Volunteer Involvement Progam (VIP) is een programma waarin community vrijwilligers worden opgenomen wanneer ze een bepaald niveau hebben bereikt binnen de Leadership Ladder. Bij het opgenomen worden in dit programma worden deze vrijwilligers erkend als Very Important Persons en komen in een database waarin de kwalificaties van de vrijwilliger zijn opgenomen. De VIP’s zijn een belangrijke bron van capaciteit bij de organisatie van lokale, regionale en (inter)nationale evenementen. Zo helpen er tijdens het WK voetbal in Zuid-Afrika een aantal VIP’s mee bij de organisatie van Adidas evenementen. Dit programma zorgt ervoor dat jongeren op een ander schaalniveau kunnen laten zien wat ze hebben bereikt, in contact komen met andere mensen en een rolmodel kunnen zijn voor mensen uit de eigen community. 

Cup of Heroes
Het belangrijkste evenement dat is opgezet om de deelnemers hun kennis en vaardigheden in praktijk te laten brengen, is the Cup of Heroes, een toernooi op regionaal en nationaal niveau met een internationale finale. Communities kunnen alleen deelnemen als hun sportvoorzieningen en de organisatie daarvan goed op orde is. In the Cup of Heroes komen alle geleerde aspecten van sport, management en levensvaardigheden samen. De teams die hun community vertegenwoordigen kunnen letterlijk binnen én buiten het veld scoren. Onder andere aan de hand van een portfolio waarin communities hun vorderingen laten zien op het gebied van sport, fair play en de sociale betrokkenheid van het team, worden punten toegewezen. Sociale betrokkenheid komt neer op het aanpakken van een actueel probleem dat leeft in de community, Te denken valt aan een campagne over gezonde voeding, verminderen van criminaliteit of het wegnemen van stereotypering rond een thema als mensen met een handicap. Het team dat the Cup of Heroes wint, wint dus niet alleen door sportief talent, maar ook op basis van bewezen betrokkenheid bij de community en management- en levensvaardigheden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:42.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting","info.nl@score.org.za","","150899882","","","SCORE Zuid-Afrika","","None","314","2009-11-05","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

In al onze projecten introduceren we duurzame en ecologisch verantwoorde technieken en oplossingen, die betaalbaar zijn voor de armsten. We vervangen dure en milieubelastende materialen als staal en beton door natuurlijke materialen zoals aarden blokken. In onze scholenbouwprojecten hergebruiken we de bergstenen en de kozijnen, maar we bouwen ook muren van plastic flessen. En zeer belangrijk, we zorgen dat de lokale mensen vanaf de eerste dag bij hun eigen project betrokken zijn. Deze factor is van groot belang voor het slagen van de projecten, omdat zo de betrokkenheid en verantwoordelijkheden bij de mensen zelf liggen. Zo bouwden wij de afgelopen 6 jaar een school in India, 12 aardbevingsbestendige bergscholen, een regionale veekliniek en een hostel voor blinde studenten in Nepal.

Een groot verschil met andere stichtingen is dat we elk project persoonlijk en ter plekke begeleiden en dat we zelf daadwerkelijk aanwezig zijn op de bouwplaats. We geven uitgebreide trainingen aan de locale arbeiders, zodat de kennis in de dorpen achterblijft. We zijn constant bezig met supervisie en sturing zodat we zeker zijn van de bouwkwaliteit en waardoor we kunnen garanderen dat onze uitgaven optimaal besteed worden. En… Smart Shelter Foundation doet al haar werk op vrijwillige basis, waardoor we jaarlijks vrijwel geen overhead kosten hebben!

Onze filosofie en werkwijze heeft geresulteerd in een finaleplek in de grootste ontwerpwedstrijd in de wereld: Index Award 2009. Het thema was ‘Design to Improve Life’ en deze nominatie was voor ons een prachtig compliment! Ik ben zeer trots op de succesvolle resultaten die wij in zo’n korte tijd hebben neergezet!","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:03.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting onder KvK nummer 28104850 en aangemerkt als ANBI bij de Belastingdienst onder nummer 24635","info@smartshelterfoundation.org","ABN Amro","436025469","","","Smart Shelter Foundation","Stadhuisplein 12,  2405 SH","Netherlands","943","2011-03-20","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Er zijn in deze wijk, van meer dan 1 miljoen inwoners, nu de onderstaande projecten:
Er is een school voor inclusive onderwijs, er zijn projecten voor dove, verstandelijk beperkte en lichamelijk gehandicapte kinderen. Ook zijn er 2 scholen die zich toeleggen op de Hindu kinderen en de drop-outs. Deze projecten hebben veel contact met elkaar en worden op het gebied van organisatie management training begeleid door Corien van der Velde met als doel meer structuur in de planning en ook een betere fundraising op de lange termijn. 
Voor 2012 hebben we ons met name gericht op training op het gebied het management en een bus voor SHAN academy, een school voor inclusive onderwijs met ook een grote groep dove kinderen.

De missie luidt ""Het gebruik van duurzame energie te bevorderen, met name zonne-energie"".

De stichting's akte is gepasseerd op 24/12/2009, en de KvK inschrijving is op 30/12 voltooid. Per 1/12/2010 was alles rond behalve de bankrekening.

De stichting heeft een drieledig bestuur met de volgende functionarissen:
-Mw. J. Knopper - Voorzitter
-Mw. R. Dekker - Secretaris
-Mw. M. Ronday - Penningmeester
Inmiddels is er een Rabobank rekening geopend, met mw. Dekker en Ronday als enige beheerders.

Mijn rol is operationeel, in beginsel vrijwillig. Ik zorg voor contact met Kenia, het identificeren van projecten en het bewaken van de voortgang. De bankrekening wordt door het bestuur beheerd.

De stichting is ontstaan naar aanleiding van een geslaagde zending van ziekenhuisspullen naar een kliniekje in Namanga, Kenia, in 2008. De betrokkenen besloten een vehikel in het leven te roepen waarmee meer structureel gewerkt kon worden met Keniaanse partners. Ze kozen voor duurzame energie als kernactiviteit omdat energie onmisbaar is in een economie, en de overvloedige zon een onbeperkte bron daarvan biedt.
Er is niet eerder projectmatig met Wakomboe gewerkt, maar dhr. Gathu en mw. Ronday hebben wel financiële donaties aan de kerk gegeven.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:16.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting, KvK 32164567","blessedsun10@gmail.com","","155615599","","","Stichting Blessed Sun","","None","386","2010-02-12","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Daarnaast zijn we bezig om een school te bouwen. De naam 'Bokemei' betekent in het Ghanees 'Jij en de ander' en staat voor samenwerking. 

Initiatiefnemer en voorzitter is de heer Anetey Abbey, zelf Ghanees en al 30 jaar in Nederland woonachtig. Hij weet als geen ander wat armoede en dakloos zijn betekent. Daarom wil hij iets terugdoen voor zijn land. Samen met een groep gemotiveerde mensen uit diverse culturen. Doel van onze stichting zoals omschreven in de statuten is het promoten van goed onderwijs voor  arme (wees)kinderen.  

In de twee arme stadswijken LA en Teshie van de hoofdstad Accra, bieden we al  8 jaar financiële ondersteuning aan families van 16 weeskinderen. Hun eigen familie neemt hen op in huis en zij gaan ook naar school. Op deze manier wordt voorkomen dat zij in een weeshuis belanden. 
Door het weeskinderen project merkten we hoe hoog de nood is. Teveel kinderen en vooral meisjes gaan niet naar school. Ook laat de kwaliteit en bereikbaarheid van onderwijsvoorzieningen te wensen over.

Projecten waar Bokemei nu mee bezig is:
Bouw school voor voorbereidend vakonderwijs 
Op verzoek van de locale koning en bevolking staan we nu voor de uitdaging om een school te bouwen voor voorbereidend vakonderwijs. In Ghana noemen ze dat een Junior Secundary School (JSS). De school biedt onderwijskansen voor honderd jongeren. Aansluitend worden banen gecreëerd.
Daarnaast zijn we ism de locale bevolking gestart met kleine economische projecten.

Kenniscentrum 
Kennis is macht. Daarom komt er bij de school ook een kenniscentrum. Jong en oud kan hier kennis brengen en halen. Er komen praktijklokalen, er worden trainingen en bijeenkomsten georganiseerd en banen gecreëerd. Zo ondersteunen we de bevolking om hun eigen toekomst te verbeteren.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KVK nr. 34178606","info@bokemei.nl","ING","P9435539","NL41INGB0009435539","INGBNL2A","Stichting Bokemei","Amsterdam","Netherlands","318","2009-11-07","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Onze gemeenschappelijke Europese achtergrond is een groot voordeel in het zaken doen.
De stichting, zowel hier als in Kenia zet zich in voor de 7000 inwoners van het dorp Mtangani (nabij Malindi aan de oostkust van Kenia) d.m.v diverse projecten om hun levensstandaard te verhogen. Ook heeft het verhogen van hun zelfredzaamheid een hoge prioriteit.
Hiervoor hebben we eerst een basis gelegd door het realiseren van een waterpompinstallatie werkend op zonne-energie (januari 2008). 
Geleidelijk aan groeiden we naar de volgende uitdaging toe, omdat we vonden dat ontwikkelingshulp niet uitsluitend moet bestaan uit geld geven. Door het microkrediet te starten in dit dorp is er veel verandert in het leven van de vrouwen. We zijn begonnen met vrouwen een lening te geven, variërend van 50 tot 200 euro om hun eigen bedrijfje te starten. Inmiddels zijn er dat 80!
Door dit project is er een enorm women-empowerment door de regio gegaan en hebben ze een stem gekregen. Tot voor kort werd dit voor onmogelijk gehouden, maar het is nu een groep die steeds sterker wordt en zich bewust gaan worden van hun kwaliteiten. Vanuit de bevolking is de vraag om volwassen onderwijs ontstaan. Met behulp van o.a.. de 1%CLUB hebben we in februari 2010, in 1 maand een school gebouwd.
Nu is er vraag naar een marktplaats in Mtangani, waar de bevolking hun handel kan verkopen en niet meer afhankelijk zijn van de grote stad. Omdat we nu ook de steun hebben van de locale overheid is de tijd daar nu rijp voor.

Ik bezoek regelmatig zelf de projecten (op eigen kosten)  om zo vinger aan de pols te houden. Laatste bezoek was 5-15 mrt 2010,
maar ga in oktober met een cameraman en fotograaf weer naar Mtangani.

- het bevorderen van intercultureel contact, sociale cohesie en wederzijds respect; 
- het bevorderen en stimuleren van grensoverstijgende uitwisselingen. 

Het bestuur van Stichting Multi-Pass bestaat uit:
voorzitter: Hester van Zwet 
secretaris: Yvonne van der Bijl 
penningmeester: Joost van Engen 

Coordinator / fondsenwerver: Esther Langen

Stichting Multi-Pass is opgericht in mei 2007. De bestuursleden hebben vanuit hun werk en interesse veel kennis en ervaring op het gebied van sociale vraagstukken en ontwikkelingssamenwerking. 

Esther Langen is al langer betrokken bij projecten in Senegal, in samenwerking met de Foyer des Jeunes in Diofior. In 2001 is zij door SIW Internationale Vrijwilligersprojecten uitgezonden naar een project in Senegal. Daar heeft zij contacten gelegd voor de latere samenwerking. Het eerste gezamenlijke project is gestart in 2005. Dit project was gericht op het opzetten van een computercentrum om de bevolking van het dorp Diofior toegang te geven tot e-mail en internet. Een ander project van Multi-Pass en de Foyer des Jeunes – gestart in juni 2007 – is gericht op afvalrecycling. De betrokkenheid van Multi-Pass is dat de stichting Nederlandse stagiaires en vrijwilligers werft, selecteert en voorbereidt op vrijwilligerswerk voor dit project in Senegal, en dat zij de Foyer des Jeunes en de gehandicaptenvereniging adviseert en ondersteunt. 
De Foyer des Jeunes neemt een centrale plek in in het dorp. De formele structuur is een NGO / vereniging met een bestuur. De foyer voert projecten uit in nauw overleg met de burgemeester en de raadsleden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:41.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

WACA was founded by a group of formerly abducted children who were particularly dedicated to the empowerment of war victims in the region. This group of formerly abducted children felt challenged by the marginalization of war victims especially young mothers in the development arena, These founder members took it upon themselves to develop a friendly financial environment where women would be counseled, trained on sustainable Agricultural production, the benefits of savings mobilization; credit accessibility and appropriate utilization of credit to enable them attain economic empowerment. 
Mission: To improve the quality of life of children/youths who have been affected by the war in Northern Uganda by providing them with resource and opportunity for achieving their potential for successful and fulfilling life.
Vision: Educated social well-reintegrated economically stable youth in Northern Uganda.

We open the computer center at this very same place that is plot 6 olya road Gulu town northern Uganda where our office is located.
The great result that we have witnessed is that all the beneficiaries in the 8 groups have got full knowledge in managing their small scale business as well as experience in village saving and loaning including proper management of small fund they are generating out of their small scale business.
The following are the 3 sub-counties where the micro-finance project were expanded these include, Awach, Patiko-Ajulu and Lalogi all are found in Gulu district nortern Uganda.
The microfinance results was achieved in many ways including but not limited to the following;-
•	War victims were able to better understand the concepts of savings and loaning in a group
•	War victims well re-integrated in the community through the counseling, drama, traditional, songs and plays normally organized by the community counselors trained at the sub counties
•	Households income of the group members have increased according to the monitoring and evaluation conducted  (at least a group member is able to save from 5,000 – to 10,000 per month in a group, considering that those were the very poor among the communities
•	Psychosocial distressed/problems (trauma) among the war victims has reduced as a result of community counselors trained 
•	Most of the group members are engaged in a profitable Income Generating Activities (IGAs)
•	More than 30 groups are now in operation as a result of the 8 groups trained 
 You expanded the micro-finance project to 03 sub-counties, please state them.
The 3 sub counties were Patiko, Lalogi and Awach but mainly we expanded the number of groups in each sub county because of the need that they present to WACA 
What were some of the projects that WACF began by supporting?
WACF started by supporting scholarship for the children born in captivity and the children whose parents were killed during the war 
 Briefly say something about the agricultural projects supported by WACF. Describe the agricultural production capital that you bought with the support of WACF (e.g. seeds, tools, etc). 
WACF though of a project that can help child mothers now that they are taking care of their children single handedly, and they though of Agricultural project which will be a sustainable project after donors funding; they supported 6 groups were they have been given 12 oxen, seeds and the local farm tools
WACA currently has 6 employed staff working in “HOPE” Project (Harnessing opportunity to protect and end violence) being supported by CARE international in Uganda;- namely; Project coordinator, project officer, Accountant, and 3 sub counties coordinators. And 12 parish based volunteers, the 6 staff are a full time employees of WACA and the 12 volunteers are the support staff at the parish level
The sustainable economic empowerment project implemented by WACA and Uganda Women Finance Trust with funding from TROCARE was a big success to the community and up to date the over 40 groups mobilized and trained are still practicing the savings and loaning concepts, a good income generating activities are in place even after the end of the donor support 2 years ago, by this would mean the WACA idea to extend the same service to other community would mean sustainability after the 1%club funding","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:40.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","S.5914/5027 (National Certificate), 1676 (District Certificate office of community development officer)","","STANDARD CHARTERED BANK","0108255007900","DE05500700100958026700","SCBLGB2L","War Affected Children Association.","STANDARD CHARTERED BANK  37 GRACECHURCH STREET","United Kingdom","402","2010-03-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

The Yoba for Life concept is designed to address one of the most common health problems in resource-poor countries: every year millions of people get severely ill as a result of diarrhea, and according to recent estimates every 12 seconds a child dies from this illness (source: World Health Organization). This poses a persistent and fundamental obstacle to the social and economic development of communities in these countries. Yoba contains probiotic bacteria that maintain a healthy intestinal flora and prevent diarrhea.
 
The Yoba for Life foundation aims to locally produce and distribute Yoba in resource-poor countries. This two-dimensional strategy generates access to an affordable healthy product and offers work and business opportunities for local communities. In addition, the Yoba for Life foundation will raise awareness for a healthy lifestyle through educational programs on health, nutrition and hygiene.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","The Yoba for Life Foundation is a not-for-profit network organisation accredited by the Dutch Tax Authority as a public benefit institution (PBI / ANBI).

Through the Green Girls Project (GGP), the BYE Community Based Organization focusses on domestic biogas in order to provide a catalyst for social change, namely in the livelihoods and future prospects of young rural girls through education, but also in broader terms of health, nutrition, safety and environment.

Mission: To promote full time education for marginalized young girls (5-12) in Kigumo Constituency, Kenya and boost rural socio-economic empowerment among women.

Vision: Young girls attending full time education in Kigumo, living in safe and healthy environments.

The GGP is essentially an innovative domestic biogas initiative geared at improving the livelihoods and future prospects of young girls (aged 5-12) in rural Kenya. It addresses;
1. Gender equality
2. Education
3. Health & Hygiene
4. Nutrition
5. Environmental conservation
6. Increased agricultural productivity and employment
7. Safety (of the young girls)

The central aim of the GGP is to substitute firewood with domestic biogas in rural Kigumo households. This is done in order to indirectly relieve pressure on young girls, who are traditionally required to collect this firewood, so that they can attend school and enjoy a normal academic and physical development. This way, the opportunities for young girls to break the cycle of poverty and instigate community-wide development increase. Furthermore, the GGP incorporates a tree planting campaign contributing to carbon offsetting as well as providing an important source of nutrition for families and particularly children.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","BYE Community Based Organisation

Instigation will facilitate a variety of projects that rest on the natural talent of disadvantaged community members, with a special focus on employing women. Creating ethical and sustainable practices through global partnerships is the cornerstone of every enterprise of Instigation. Boosting economic stability and ownership can increase a community’s ability to live peaceably by providing accessible steps out of poverty.

The aim is to engender the development of sustainable local business that enable global brands to diversify and participate in new markets, reductions in production costs and increase in value propositions while creating revenue. The local initiatives are tools that chip away at the corruption and violence that threatens peace. To reach it’s mission, Instigation seeks to launch innovative partnerships with global corporations, charitable organisations, community leaders and local partners.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:34.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered with KvK 34307983, but in the process of becoming an International Charitable Trust.

Samenwerking
Bijdragen aan een gezamenlijk resultaat door een optimale afstemming tussen de kwaliteiten, talenten en belangen van de stichting, de kinderen, de donateurs, de vrijwilligers en de locale omgeving. Middels open communicatie dragen wij zorg voor het in stand houden van de samenwerking en het behalen van de doelstellingen van de stichting. 

Continuïteit
Door committent van onze donateurs en vrijwilligers is er een ononderbroken stroom van ondersteuning en liefde voor de straatkinderen. Hierdoor kan de stichting zijn fundament in Saint-Louis blijven verstevigen. Onze achterban wordt op zeer regelmatige basis voorzien van informatie over de voortgang en ontwikkeling van de stichting en de kinderen.

Bewustzijn
Bewustzijn is een toestand van de geest die gekenmerkt is door een krachtig besef van het eigen ik en de omgeving. Vanwaar uit bewuste en individuele keuzes kunnen worden gemaakt voor een rooskleurige toekomst. 

Liefde
De diepe genegenheid, respect en toewijding voor andere individuen en culturen, die resulteert in onvoorwaardelijke ruimte en vrijheid waarin de ander volledig zichzelf kan zijn.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:44:46.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting, kvk nummer 53740890","","Rabobank","166150754","NL28RABO0166150754","RABONL2U","Maison de la Lumiere","Maliebaan 15, 3581 CB Utrecht","Netherlands","1278","2011-11-29","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Daarnaast ondersteunt zij verschillende educatieve ontwikkelingsprojecten. 

De stichting is in mei 2009 opgericht door Remko van Meerendonk en Thijs Wesselink. De aanleiding voor de oprichting van deze stichting is een bijzondere reis die Thijs en Remko op dit moment maken door India, Nepal en Cambodja. Tijdens deze reis bezoeken zij verschillende ontwikkelingsprojecten en laten zij 500 Nederlandse kinderen zien hoe kinderen in deze landen leven en wat het werk is van deze lokale NGO's. Een van de eerste projecten die Remko en Thijs bezoeken is de Parikrma Humanity Foundation. Een NGO die educatie, voeding, gezinszorg en medische zorg biedt aan ruim 1100 kinderen uit de sloppenwijken van Bangalore. Stichting Ontdek en Beleef de Wereld heeft 25 XO laptops van OLPC gedoneerd aan Parikrma en is op dit moment bezig met de implementatie en evaluatie van OLPC bij Parikrma. Daarnaast is zij ook het project ""Wereldpraatjes"" gestart, waarbij ruim 100 kinderen uit de slums van Bangalore direct in contact komen met de 500 Nederlandse kinderen die aan het project deelnemen.

Pure! zet zich, in samenwerking met lokale gemeenschappen en partnerorganisaties, in voor de verbetering van de leefsituatie en het toekomstperspectief van Cambodjaanse kinderen. Daarbij staan onderwijs, sociale ontwikkeling en een goede gezondheid centraal. Naast het bieden van financiële steun zijn de inzet en kracht van vrijwilligers de sleutel tot succes. Vrijwilligers helpen direct in Cambodja door het geven van Engelse les, het ondersteunen bij een medisch project of het doen van allerhande klusjes ter ondersteuning van de gemeenschap. 

Na twee jaar partnerprojecten te hebben gesteund, opende PURE! in mei 2010 in Cambodja het PURE! Dream Centre. Een onderwijscentrum waar 60 kansarme kinderen uit de Kandek gemeenschap, zo’n 10 kilometer buiten Siem Reap, hun dromen waar kunnen maken. PURE! biedt de kinderen in de leeftijd van 6 tot 11 jaar gratis onderwijs op het gebied van Engelse les, hygiëne, creativiteit, computerles, sportieve activiteiten en sociale begeleiding. Daarnaast wordt de kinderen een veilige omgeving geboden waarin ze worden gerespecteerd en zich kunnen ontwikkelen. PURE! draagt niet alleen bij aan de ontwikkeling van de kinderen, maar ook aan de gehele gemeenschap door het creëren van werk bij de bouw, het in dienst nemen van tot nu toe zes medewerkers en het ondersteunen van de bevolking door de inzet van een maatschappelijk werker.

Ik, Maarten Stoffels, een Nederlandse arts, woonde en werkte van 2006 tot 2008 in Choibalsan en kwam in contact met de kinderen en met Boldsaikhan, de Mongoolse man die eind 2006 begonnen was met het geven van zorg. Samen richtten wij de Mongoolse NGO  All for Children op. In Nederland richtte ik een Stichting op met dezelfde naam om de Mongoolse NGO te helpen deze kinderen aan een toekomst als volwaardig mens te helpen.
In 2007 konden wij Anna Home kopen, een huis waarin de kinderen nu wonen en verzorgd worden door een staf van 3 opvoeders en 2 man hulppersoneel. Boldsaikhan is nu directeur. Alle kinderen gaan naar school, wat velen lang niet gedaan hadden.
De kosten worden tot nu toe vrijwel geheel gedragen door de Nederlandse stichtging, maar geleidelijk aan zullen we proberen om veel meer Mongoolse bijdragen te verwerven. De overheid doet niets tot nu toe.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:48.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Pepijn Trapman werkte dat jaar als vrijwilliger in Kyrgyzstan( Kirgizië). De organisatie waar hij voor werkte was een afdeling van het Engelse ""Every Child"". Zij hadden op dat moment een vestiging in de hoofdstad Bishkek en in Talas. Een plaats in het Noord-Oosten en één van de armste gebieden in dit tóch al straat arme land.Pepijn kreeg de opdracht om een project op te zetten dat de leefomstandigheden van gezinnen met een gehandicapt kind duurzaam te verbeteren. Het was zijn keus om het project in Talas en omgeving te ontwikkelen.

Als een vrouw in Kyrgyzstan een gehandicapt kind krijgt wordt haar dat in veel gevallen kwalijk genomen. Zo'n vrouw kan niet deugen dus wordt zij door haar man verlaten en vaak door haar familie verstoten. Zij heeft geen bron van inkomsten als zij niet werkt. Werk is schaars en zla zij werkt moet haar kind alleen worden gelaten. Pepijn heeft bedacht dat door het schenken van een koe de situatie van het gezin aanmerkelijk kan worden verbeterd. Een koe geeft sociale status, er moet wel een hogere macht zijn waardoor de vrouw een koe heeft gekregen, zij hoort er weer bij, kan de zuivel voor eigen gebruik aanwenden en het overschot verkopen. Op deze wijze is een klein inkomen, hoe minimaal ook, gegarandeerd. Pepijn heeft als proef zélf een koe gedoneerd om na te gaan hoe dit zou kunnen functioneren. Dat ging goed, er zijn selectie criteria opgesteld en zijn familie is gevraagd om allerlei acties te ontwikkelen om aan geld voor koeien te komen. Na het vertrek van Pepijn heeft 'Every Child"" het project zelfstandig voortgezet. het project begon ""te lopen""en al spoedig bleek het verder uitbouwen van het project een dagtaak waar Every Child geen capaciteit voor had. Besloten is om bij Every Child een arbeidsplaats te betalen. Dit geld komt van de ouders van Pepijn en Pepijn zelf. En staat los van de donaties voor koeien. Daar worden uiteraard koeien van aangeschaft. ""Koeienmeisje Nargiza"" heeft sindsdien een dagtaak aan ons project. Eind 2008 is besloten de activiteiten in Nederland in de Stichting ""Geefeenkoe.nl"" onder te brengen mat een stichtingsbestuur. Dat was op het moment dat Pepijn, toen werkzaam voor ICCO als regiomanager, weer terugging naar Kyrgyzstan. Hij is als vrijwilliger nu onze ""uitkijkpost"" in Kyrgyzstan. Tot eind 2010 zijn in totaal cq. 120 koeien gedoneerd en aangeschaft op de locale veemarkt in Talas.

Het gaat om kinderen die (seksueel) mishandeld zijn, uitgehuwelijkt dreigen te worden of vroeg zwanger zijn geraakt. Jua biedt hen traumaverwerking, bemiddeling, onderdak en stimuleert hen om naar school te blijven gaan.

De organisatie in Nederland bestaat uit 6 personen, bestaande uit het bestuur en één toegevoegd iemand; voor meer info  verwijs ik graag naar: http://www.tileng.nl/home/het-bestuur/8.

De Stichting Tileng houdt zich in Nederland bezig met fundraising en alles wat daarmee samenhangt.  Van meet af aan is de organisatie zich ervan bewust, dat het initiatief voor het ontwikkelen van projecten bij de lokale bevolking ligt en niet bij de organisatie in Nederland. Dit komt ook duidelijk tot uitdrukking in de statuten: “De stichting heeft ten doel de verbetering van de leef- en woonsituatie, in de breedste zin van het woord, van de bewoners van het eiland Java in Indonesië in het algemeen en van de Desa Tileng in het bijzonder. De stichting tracht haar doel onder meer te bereiken door het initiëren, begeleiden en financieren van projecten van de lokale bevolking.”.
De filosofie achter deze doelstelling is, zoals gezegd, dat er alleen geld beschikbaar wordt gesteld voor projecten die door de lokale bevolking ontwikkeld en gedragen worden. Mensen ter plekke weten als geen ander wat de woon- en leefsituatie structureel kan verbeteren. Daarom is voor deze doelstelling gekozen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:53:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting Tileng is geregistreerd bij de Kamer van Koophandel in Rotterdam onder nummer 24307222.

Om toch de kinderen hun opleiding af te laten maken, hebben we in eerste instantie zelf het schoolgeld betaald. Om dit structureel te laten worden hebben we de stichting Zambia Child Foundation opgericht.
Onze stichting houdt zich bezig met:
o	de weeskinderen in ons aandachtsgebied van een basisopleiding voorzien
o	het verbeteren van de leefomstandigheden in de regio waar we werkzaam zijn.
We zijn werkzaam in het gebied tussen Mazabuka en Monze, genaamd Kayuni South, in de Southern Province van Zambia. De stichting bestaat uit drie man en werkt intensief samen met de lokale gemeenschap en organisaties.

East African Youth Assembly was founded as per the resolutions of the youth summit of people from country members of East African Community namely Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda convening at Arusha- Tanzania from the 2nd to 3rd November 2007 for the East African Youth Summit organized by East African Community Youth Organization (EACYO):

Having received the country perspectives on the role of youth in the East African integration and development process;

Having reflected upon the theme “Networking to realize the role of youth in East African Community Integration and development process” through various topical presentations and discussions;

Recalling the Treaty for the establishment of the East African Community particularly the guiding principle of ensuring that the East African Community is people centered, private sector led and market driven.

Recognizing that youth of East Africa are important stakeholder in the EAC processes since they form substantial part of the population that can influence policies formulation, participate in community mobilization/sensitization and implementation due to their creativity and energy. East Africa Youth Parliament conducts a few, highly focused programs aimed at engaging Youth in Eastern Africa in the addressing of specific concerns affecting them, as well as enabling their participation in the design of policies they may have a key stake in, and in influencing decisions in the development thereof.
The voices of young people are increasingly being heard in communities across Africa – in business, education, political and governance processes, service delivery, and in philanthropy. Sometimes young people struggle to be heard and, sometimes, they are invited to be part of development and evaluative processes. In an increasing number of cases, they are creating their own decision-making roles.
Research and our own experiences tell us that when young people have meaningful decision-making roles, stronger communities are built, and young people construct their own protective factors against risk. EAYP will strive to ensure that young people participate in and have the opportunity to make decisions and they have a connection to this organization and the broader community. This philosophy underpins the East Africa Youth Parliament.
EAYP combines the concepts associated with positive youth led development with the principles of community organizing and active citizenship, to explain how youth development within our organization and the programmes that we develop and implement promote the creation and sustainability of effective programs and services for young people in Africa.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:18.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","ORIGINALLY REGISTERED IN JANUARY 2010 IN KENYA AS EAST AFRICA YOUTH SOCIETY BUT CHANGED NAME TO EAST AFRICAN YOUTH ASSEMBLY  Certificate Number 33573","sg@eayp.or.ke","EQUITY BANK LIMITED","0150297781916","","EQBLKENA","EAST AFRICAN YOUTH ASSEMBLY,EAST AFRICAN YOUTH PARLIAMENT","015","Kenya","2042","2013-06-22","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De studenten kunnen hun kennis uit de klaslokalen op deze manier in praktijk brengen. Wij als team in Groningen bestaan uit ongeveer 15 studenten van verschillende studies. We hebben dit jaar 4 projecten die daadwerkelijk uitgevoerd gaan worden. Hiervan zijn er 3 lokale projecten, een project voor jonge moeders begeleiding, één op een asielzoekerscentrum, en een voorlichtingsproject op middelbare scholen om de aankomende meer financieel bewust te maken. Daarnaast is ons project in Tanzania het enige internationale project dit jaar. In deze projectgroep zitten we samen met 4 studentes. Wij hebben nog niet eerder een project in Tanzania uitgevoerd. Ons team in Groningen is nog vrij jong vergeleken met de teams in andere Nederlandse steden, die vaak uit meer dan 30 studenten bestaan. Wij hebben dan ook nog niet veel projecten gedaan. Het doel van ons project is het opzetten van een naaiatelier voor dove vrouwen in Dodoma. SIFE heeft naast de rol als begeleidende organisatie geen rol in het project.

Sinds 1988 heeft de gemeente Tilburg ook een band met de gemeente Matagalpa.
De stedenband is een kleine organisatie met een professioneel secretariaat en een enthousiaste groep vrijwilligers. 
Deze zijn actief op incidentele basis of het hele jaar door in een van de werkgroepen: onderwijs, vrouwen, milieu, gezondheid, koffie of de redactie van de ¡Cómo No! (het informatieblad van de stedenband).Via de werkgroepen zijn er contacten met Tilburgse organisaties en instellingen.
De gemeente Tilburg subsidieert de organisatiekosten van de stedenband. Voor projecten in Matagalpa wordt geld ingezameld door het organiseren van activiteiten en het aanschrijven van fondsen of donateurs. 
Het bestuur is verantwoordelijkheid voor het beleid van de stedenband. Vrijwilligers hebben inspraak in de Raad van Advies.

Het gaat om jongeren tussen 15 en 22 jaar die niet of nauwelijks scholing hebben gehad.

Vialisa fungeert als intermediair tussen het bedrijfsleven en de kansarme jongeren. Het is te vergelijken met een sociaal arbeidsbureau, waar het niet alleen gaat om de jongeren te plaatsen bij de bedrijven maar daar waar mogelijk deze jongeren ook een beroepsopleiding te geven. Tevens krijgen de jongeren een mentor die ze om raad kunnen vragen als het gaat om loopbaanbegeleiding. 

Door het uitgebreide netwerk van Vialisa krijgen laag- of ongeschoolde jongeren een kans zich te ontwikkelen en zich te bewijzen binnen een bedrijf. Sommige jongeren beginnen na het scholingstraject van Vialisa ook als zelfstandig ondernemer.

De doelstelling is jongeren: 
- te plaatsen bij de bedrijven die hen niet uitbuiten of gevaarlijk werk laten verrichten, 
- een opleiding te geven die de kansen op de arbeidsmarkt verhogen
- te voorzien van een mentor die ze om raad kunnen vragen als het gaat om loopbaanbegeleiding. 
- een medische keuring te geven en bij te staan bij medische problemen
- budgetbegeleiding te geven en te leren sparen voor noodsituaties
- te helpen bij problemen thuis en/of bij de werkgever.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:53:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

'Metta OutReach Foundation' long range plans include any of these needed general facilities in the areas most in need that we select to establish ourselves in, and we have chosen Kitengela as our launching pad. To start with, we are specifically focusing on opening a clinic to help the people of the Kasoito slum, near Athi River. 

~ A CLINIC: to provide critically needed HIV/AIDS education and medication and several other much needed medications.

~ AGRICULTURE AND FARMING: We plan to grow several cash crops and raise chickens and goats.

~ A SHELTER HOME: a simple luxury which most of these kids unfortunately can't claim - with school attendance a residential requirement.

~ A COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTER: to provide computer and career choice training to the community.

~ YOUTH EMPOWERMENT: We are planning to team up with a leading management mentor organization. This program will focus on morals, principles and leadership coaching. Our vision is to take these same principle concepts that are used in the building of a large successful corporation, and turn them into a community based 'youth empowerment' program to help give the youth of Kenya a better chance at self sustaining success in their immediate future.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Certified","jjenkins@mettaoutreach.org","Post Bank","","","","Metta OutReach Foundation","","Kenya","1587","2012-07-18","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

PBI traint haar vrijwilligers gedegen voordat zij vertrekken. In projecten leeft en werkt iedereen volgens de regels en wetgeving van het gastland. 

Veiligheid
PBI onderzoekt de conflictsituatie voordat zij zich verbindt aan een project. Vanuit de politieke, sociale en economische context worden de mogelijkheden voor begeleidingswerk beoordeeld en een risicoanalyse gemaakt. Het veiligheidsrisico voor vrijwilligers is daarbij een uitgangspunt. Een PBI vrijwilliger is nog nooit aangevallen.

'Luz de Vida' is tevens de naam van de lokale stichting in El Seibo waar de Seibo Werkgroep mee samenwerkt. Deze stichting bestuurt alle activiteiten op het terrein, inclusief de school. Zij regelt ook het onderhoud aan de gebouwen.

De school is niet van de overheid, maar net als veel scholen in de Dominicaanse Republiek particulier. Deze school vraagt, net als de meeste particuliere scholen in sloppenwijken, geen schoolgeld, omdat de school anders niet toegankelijk zou zijn voor kinderen uit deze wijk. De overheidsscholen vragen wel schoolgeld. In de Dominicaanse Republiek is nog veel te weinig capaciteit om alle kinderen basisonderwijs te kunnen aanbieden, ondanks de vele particuliere scholen. De school krijgt wel wat steun van de overheid, die betalen één van de leerkrachten en de maaltijd die de kinderen elke dag op school krijgen. Veel kinderen uit de wijk krijgen thuis niet altijd te eten. We werken er aan meer lokale geldstromen op gang te krijgen.

In de wijken wonen ongeveer 9000 mensen (waarvan 3000 kinderen). Daarvan gaan er ongeveer 200 naar de school. Het is per jaar deels afhankelijk van de beschikbare leerkrachten hoeveel kinderen er naar school kunnen. Het onderwijs wordt grotendeels gegeven door vrijwilligers uit de wijk zelf, die door een lokale coördinator zijn opgeleid. Het lesmateriaal is het standaardmateriaal van de overheid, dat uitgaat van beperkte kennis bij onderwijzend personeel. In de Dominicaanse Republiek hoeft alleen het schoolhoofd gediplomeerd te zijn.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:44.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Onderdeel van stichting Interkerkelijke Contacten Putten, KVK 08112690, deze stichting heeft een ANBI-status","jcbos@solcon.nl","","519480767","","","Seibo Werkgroep","","None","129","2009-06-10","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Dit doet zij door voor de korte termijn te voorzien in eerste levensbehoeften en voor de lange termijn door ervoor te zorgen dat mensen in eigen levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien. De doelstelling wordt gerealiseerd door:
• Het bieden van basisbehoefte en 
  basisvoorzieningen (voedsel, medische zorg 
  en educatie)
• Het ondersteunen van lokale initiatieven door 
  het verstrekken van financiële middelen of 
  goederen
• Het creëren van werkgelegenheid
• Het creëren van bewustzijn en het 
  genereren van steun in Nederland en 
  Colombia.

De stichting is eind 2009 opgericht en zet zich in om de leefomstandigheden voor de minder bedeelden in het dorp Paluato (voorheen Ipauratu) Colombia te verbeteren. De focus voor de aankomende jaren ligt op het mogelijk maken van onderwijs voor kleuters.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:23.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting met ANBI status

De Stichting is opgericht in mei 2006. Het bestuur bestaat uit Johan de Visser, voorzitter, Jacques Kerssemakers, penningmeester en  Caroline Westgeest, secretaris.
Waarom dit initiatief? Een persoonlijke noot: 
In mei 2006 was ik met een projectkoor te gast op het Kwetufestival  (Festival voor de vrede in Oost-Afrika) in de Oegandese stad Kampala. Opvallend en indrukwekkend was het optreden van de tambours uit Burundi. Hun virtuositeit, hun presentatie en hun moraal maakten grote indruk op ons, zeker als je bedenkt dat ze uit het op twee na armste land van de wereld komen. We maakten kennis met het goede werk van de Rukinzo Legacy en besloten, terug in Nederland, deze dappere tambours te helpen. Moreel en financieel. Maar we wisten nog niet hoe, want je kunt niet zo maar een zak met geld sturen. Toen bleek dat onze partnerorganisatie al heel lang projectplannen had liggen, waarvoor zij in Burundi geen geld hadden weten te krijgen: de educatieve trommelprojecten. Uiteindelijk ligt het initiatief en het ontwerp van het trommelproject bij de partnerorganisatie in Burundi. Met eigen middelen hebben wij toen de stichting Rhythm for Revival opgericht en een eerste donatie gedaan. We hebben gezien dat de plaatselijke secretaris van de Legacy er persoonlijk op toeziet dat het geld besteed wordt aan instrumenten, kleding, lesmaterialen, aan het honorarium van de opleiders, het huren van ruimte en het verplaatsen van tambours en hun instrumenten. Caroline Westgeest, koordirigent: 
""Sinds de oprichting in 2006 hebben wij 9 projecten in Burundi kunnen ondersteunen en zijn er al heel wat kinderen en jongeren opgeleid, zo'n 4.000, waarbij de muziek centraal staat en de overige educatieve thema’s allemaal via de muziek worden aangeboden. Mooi hè? De trommelles wordt even stilgelegd en de leerlingen nemen in hun enthousiasme ook andere informatie op. Ook worden de onderwerpen via liederen verder verspreid. Zo zijn er (zelfgemaakte) liederen over de preventie van Aids, over verzoening en vrede.  Voortdurend wordt de projectleider in Burundi benaderd door nieuwe wijken, waar men ook behoefte heeft aan scholing,voorlichting en herwaardering van de eigen trommelcultuur. De donateurs van de 1%CLUB hebben ons dit jaar geweldig geholpen met de inrichting van een nieuwe lesplaats in Gihosha!!","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:21.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Er worden die middelen gefinancierd die ervoor zorgen dat arme kinderen (basis)onderwijs kunnen volgen, zoals voor leermiddelen, sanitair, schooluniformen, schooltuinen voor educatie én schoolmaaltijden.

De aanleiding om Siyafunda op te richten was de slechte situatie van kinderen in de township Tembisa en op het platteland van Kentani. Veel kinderen hebben of leven zonder ouders, vaak zijn grootmoeders verantwoordelijk voor
de kinderen die opgroeien in grote armoede. De scholen in de townships en op het platteland hebben zo weinig middelen dat het onderwijs op een bijzonder laag peil staat. Om de kinderen een betere toekomst te geven is het noodzakelijk dat de school ze meer kan bieden, niet alleen een schooluniform en een gezonde schoollunch, maar ook voedsel voor de geest dmv leermiddelen, excursies en buitenschoolse activiteiten zoals sport en muziek.
Siyafunda Nederland ondersteunt scholen in arme delen van Zuid-Afrika, in samenwerking met Siyafunda Educational Support Trust in Johannesburg, stichtingen zonder “strijkstok”. In Jo'burg coördineren twee Nederlandse expats het werk.
Thans worden een school in Tembisa, een grote township bij Johannesburg, en een school in Kentani, bij East London, ondersteund. We doen dat door leermiddelen bij te dragen en zaken zoals aanschaf van schoolkleding mogelijk te maken. Ouders en scholen dragen zelf de verantwoordelijkheid om de benodigde gelden op te brengen. Siyafunda draagt maximaal 20% van de kosten bij van gekozen projecten. Uiteindelijk kunnen de scholen zonder hulp van derden draaien en zijn de ouders zelf in staat zijn hun kinderen naar school te laten gaan.
Ook in Zuid-Afrika heeft de trust geen bezoldigde krachten. Ter plekke is het bestuur, waarin beide Nederlanders een centrale rol vervullen, verantwoordelijk voor het toezicht op het project.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:44.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Om alle 90 kinderen een plekje te kunnen bieden in dit weeshuis is uitbreiding (het meest) noodzakelijk.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:38:58.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Hope Alive Uganda richt zich o.a. op onderwijs en het verbeteren van de leefsituatie van de kinderen en het opzetten van gezondheidsprogramma's (bv. voorlichting over HIV/AIDS). Daarnaast wil Hope Alive Uganda een groot project opzetten waardoor de bevolking in hun eigen bestaan kan gaan voorzien. Dit project is een landbouw/groenten project en geiten/kippen project. De bevolking wil groenten en mais gaan verbouwen om dit te verkopen en om zelf van te kunnen eten. Daarnaast wil de bevolking kippen en geiten fokken om deze te verkopen. Met dit project verdient de bevolking geld en kan zij ook investeren in het welzijn van de weeskinderen en arme gezinnen.

Hope Alive Uganda bestaat uit de volgende personen:

Eddy Kiirya Mpoya (director)
Dr. Simon Peter Oullo (chairman)
Florence Nangobi (treasurer)
Jonathan Kalisha (member)
Filder Namulondo
Rev. Kajastine Okurut (accountant)

Esther Haaisma (facilitator Kisozi in Nederland)

In 2005 heeft Eddy Kiirya Mpoya het land dat hij in Kisozi bezat verkocht om de stichting Hope Alive Uganda op te richten omdat hij iets wilde betekenen voor de weeskinderen en arme bevolking van Kisozi. Via Nabuur ben ik, Esther Haaisma, in contact gekomen met Eddy Kiirya Mpoya en sinds begin 2009 zet ik mij vanuit Nederland samen met hem in om  dingen op het gebied van onderwijs, gezondheid en landbouw te realiseren in Kisozi. Ik heb dagelijks contact met Eddy Kiirya Mpoya om de voortgang hiervan te bespreken, afspraken te maken en ideeen en ervaringen uit te wisselen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Hope Alive Uganda is in Uganda geregistreerd als CBO.

Het hoofdkantoor van ChildsLife is gevestigd in Haarlem.

ChildsLife is een internationale hulporganisatie die zich inzet voor kinderen in ontwikkelingslanden. Onze hulp richt zich voornamelijk op onze vier kernprogramma's: Onderwijs, HIV/AIDS zorg, Voedsel en Infrastructuur.

Het gaat ChildsLife om de praktische oplossingen, van het bouwen van een klaslokaal, tot het aanleggen van een watervoorziening en van het bieden van zorg aan moeders met HIV tot het inrichten van een slaapzaal.

Onze aanpak is het leveren van hulp op maat, met behulp van onze partnerorganisaties en de lokale werknemers op onze regio kantoren in Kenia en Roemenie.

Wij huren een bescheiden kantoorruimte in Nairobi. Er werken hier drie lokale personen, de Kenia directeur, kantoor assistente en een sociaal werker. Wij hebben ook nog een klein kantoortje in Kibera bemand door één persoon die werkt als veldwerker. Het kantoor in Kenia is verantwoordelijk voor de lopende gang van zaken bij de projecten. Zij zijn dagelijks contactpunt voor de verschillende partnerorganisaties. Tevens houden zij het hoofdkantoor op de hoogte van de voortgang van de programma's. 

Sinds 2001 heeft ChildsLife het CBF keurmerk. Dit keurmerk wordt verstrekt door het Centraal Bureau Fondsenwerving (CBF), een onafhankelijke stichting die al sinds 1925 toezicht houdt op de inzameling van geld voor goede doelen. 

Per 1 januari 2008 heeft de Belastingdienst ChildsLife aangemerkt als Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling (ANBI ). Vanaf deze datum hebben ANBI instellingen fiscale voordelen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:20.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Vanaf 2011 is er gestart met organisatiemanagement trainingen voor de verschillende projecten vooral om de organisatiestructuur te verbeteren en ook de projecten meer inzicht te geven in hun eigen plannen en financiele situatie. Veel van de werkzaamheden wordt uitgevoerd op vrijwillige basis hetgeen veel verloop van het personeel met zich meebrengt. 
Special Kids Pakistan heeft de afgelopen jaren al verschillende zaken kunnen realiseren:
- financiering van de bovenstaande trainingen
- financiering van 2 Suzuki Pick up vans voor 2 verschillende schooltjes
- verscheping van een container met revalidatiematerialen
- elke 2 jaar een training sessie door NL ergotherapeuten 
- financiering van laptops voor alle projecten","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:20.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Special Kids Pakistan is een stichting en bij de Kamer van Koophandel geregistreerd: 52340961, BTW nr. : 850403091 en ANBI geregistreerd","karin.murk@planet.nl","","","","","Special Kids Pakistan","","South Sudan","1976","2013-05-12","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Zij heeft gewerkt in het weeshuis Missahoe Children's Home. 

Dit weeshuis heeft noodzakelijk een nieuw onderkomen nodig! Er is al begonnen met de bouw, d.w.z. dat de fundering er ligt. Helaas zijn de middelen niet toereikend en kan er op dit moment niet meer verder worden gegaan met de bouw. Als de bouw van het weeshuis zijn doorgang kan vinden, betekent dat het Missahoe Children’s Home onderdak kan bieden aan 200 weeskinderen. Op dit moment wonen er 37 kinderen in de oude veel te kleine locatie. 

Met een kapitaalinjectie van €5.000,- ten bate van aanschaf van kozijnen en ramen, hopen we de bouw nieuw leven in te blazen. Hopelijk kan het weeshuis dan snel afgebouwd worden. 

Stichting Missahoe Wonder zoekt daarvoor sponsoren en/of donateurs.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:34.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KVK 27328908","info@stichtingmissahoe-wonder.nl","","104200006","","","Stichting Missahoe Wonder","","None","244","2009-07-11","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

sinds september 2006 ben ik betrokken bij veel verschillende projecten in Rundu en wijde omgeving. Mijn man is VSO-vrijwilliger, zie 'dvd's voor Kavango'. Ik heb veel tijd om met Nederlands geld projecten uit te voeren. Zo zijn er hier al diverse crèches gebouwd, kerken gerenoveerd en bij Takwasa een hek om het internaat geplaatst.
Het bestuur van het internaat heeft zich verantwoordelijk verklaard en zal de huidige tuinman aansturen.
Daarnaast is het een goed project voor de lessen Landbouw en Biologie op school.
Vanwege het feit dat het internaat dicht bij de rivier ligt, is er aan water geen gebrek. Vorig jaar hebben wij  kans gezien met Nederlands geld een waterleiding aan te leggen voor de tuin.
Als dit plan echt gerealiseerd kan worden, zou het zeker een duurzaam project kunnen worden in de vorm van een kleine boerderij.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:44:53.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Natuurlijk persoon.","margnic@gmail.com","","1373026","","","Margareeth de Jong","","None","3","2009-02-17","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Sinds november 2008 runnen wij ons eigen kindertehuis in Phnom Penh samen met vrijwilligers. 

De stichting in Nederland bestaat uit een bestuur en werkt samen met vrijwilligers om onze projecten te promoten en om vrijwilligers voor te lichten die gaan werken in Cambodja bij 1 van onze projecten. 

De dagelijkse leiding ligt in handen van Nicoline Westen, de oprichtster en voorzitter van Stichting PURE! for kids. Het bestuur bestaat uit 3 leden:  Nicoline Westen, Bianca Ramaker en Goedhart Westen. In Nederland werken wij met 3 actieve vrijwilligers en in Cambodja werken wij met 2 actieve vrijwilligers rechstreeks voor PURE!. Elke maand werken tussen de 5 tot 10 mensen in Cambodja binnen 1 van de projecten. PURE! werkt met een stuk of 8 projecten in zowel Siem Reap, het platteland bij Siem Reap als in Phnom Penh bij het kindertehuis. Dit is van lokale partners. 

Er zijn altijd enthousiaste vrijwilligers aanwezig, vrijwilligers helpen met het geven van Engelse les, bouwen/opknappen van schooltje of kindertehuis en verzorging van kinderen. De vrijwilligers zijn niet verantwoordelijk voor de kinderen. De dagelijkse leiding in het kindertehuis is in handen van Cambodjaanse medewerkers en PURE! for kids. 
De vrijwilligers die elke maand komen (minimaal verblijf 2 weken) kunnen ook de naai- en computerlessen geven bij interesse en talenten op dit gebied.

Via de activiteiten wilde – en wil – ze iets doen tegen het enorme leed van de AIDS-wezen in Zambia. 
De Stichting voert campagnes in Nederland en daarbuiten om geld bij elkaar te brengen voor het Palabana Children’s Village , genoemd naar het dorp Palabana (ongeveer 25 km ten ZO van Lusaka), waar het kinderdorp is gebouwd. 
Pola, het bestuur en de vele vrijwilligers hebben niet stilgezeten. Het dorp bestaat inmiddels uit:
·	11 huisjes voor de 100 kinderen met ‘moeders’, hun begeleiders.
·	Een varkenshouderij, waarvan het gefokte vlees deels zelf wordt gebruikt, deels wordt verkocht;
·	Een pluimveehouderij met 500 vleeskippen, 800 legkippen en kwartels;
·	Veehouderij: de 2 koeien geven voldoende melk voor de kinderen;
·	Een tuinderij die niet alleen voldoende eten voor het dorp geeft maar waarvan een deel van de opbrengst ook verkocht wordt;
·	Een school met een ‘skills center’ waar jongens lessen in houtbewerking krijgen en de meubels voor de nieuwe huisjes maken; meisjes leren er naaien;
·	Een medische post;
·	Een winkel waarin producten van eigen teelt worden verkocht.
De MOV van Vinkel bestond in 2009 20 jaar. In die tijd heeft ze zich met verve ingezet voor derde wereld landen. Via voorlichting – vooral op scholen – en fondsenwerving werden heel wat kleinschalige projecten van geld voorzien. De projecten die geholpen werden hadden altijd als doel de eigen redzaamheid te vergroten.
In het jubileumjaar 2009 werden extra veel activiteiten ondernomen met als doel de bouw van een Gemeenschapshuis in Palabana te realiseren. In 2010 hoopt de MOV alle benodigde gelden voor deze Community Hall aan de Pola van der Donck Stichting over te kunnen maken.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:48.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","De MOV is een werkgroep van de Parochie O.L.V. vd Rozenkrans te Vinkel.

GOET is dedicated to improving the lives of orphans and neglected children in remote communities in Busoga. Our focus on the community helps us to have a wider reaching impact in the lives of children and families made vulnerable through poverty, disease and circumstances beyond their control.
The initial focus was empowerment through education opportunities. GOET has however expanded its programs to bridge this gap through initiatives that address orphans, the girl child, women, youth empowerment, education and talent development. 
Through successful implementation of various community education and development based programs, the CBO has been credited by the non residents and residents for its immense contribution in improving the welfare of young people. Its primary beneficiaries have been mainly the highly disadvantaged children and youth in the area.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:32.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","GOET is a registered CBO with a registration number of 2049","info@goetug.org","DIAMOND TRUST BANK","0605553553","","DTKEUGKA","GLOBAL ORPHANS EDUCATION TRUST","Jinja Branch Plot 32/ 34, Main Street,  Jinja,  Uganda","Uganda","1794","2013-01-15","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Created out of great demands to meet the needs of children with limited parental care, GLOWA is active in combating child trafficking and the damages it creates in communities throughout the Northwest Region using varied approaches that range from community education to prevent trafficking, rescue and direct support to victims, and advocacy. Through these works, GLOWA aims to systematically transform communities and nurture a culture of respect for human rights, particularly those of children and women while fighting against the systematic abuses faced by the most vulnerable. 
Based on its strong believe that every child should grow in an environment where s/he feels free, valued, and given the opportunity to maximize his/her potentials without succumbing to domestic and sexual servitude, GLOWA aspire to build child-friendly and abuse-sensitive communities where children are empowered as claim holders and promoters of their basic human rights. We are committed to upholding these rights as a way of preparing future generations of Cameroonians to become productive citizens of society.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:38.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","E.30/201/980 of 13th February 2004","glowa21@gmail.com","Banque Atlantique, Cameroun","91113880007","","ATCRCMCM","GLOWA - Global Welfare Association","Commercial Avenue","Cameroon","1002","2011-05-10","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De Seibo Werkgroep (voorheen Peru Actiegroep) stelt zich ten doel een basisschool in de sloppenwijk van El Seibo te ondersteunen.

Een aantal lokalen is al in gebruik. De komende jaren gaan we met een aantal mensen, samen met de locale bevolking, dit verder afmaken en, ter beveiliging, het terrein ommuren.

Wat we de komende jaren gaan doen
In de zomers van 2009 en 2010 hopen we weer af te reizen naar El Seibo om te gaan bouwen. Beide jaren hebben we ongeveer 16 deelnemers nodig en rond de € 35.000. Het is de bedoeling dat we dan een muur rondom het terrein van de school gaan bouwen. Deze muur is in de Dominicaanse Republiek verplicht rondom iedere school. Bovendien is er steeds meer overlast van mensen die dag en nacht over het terrein lopen, waarbij regelmatig dingen gestolen worden. Denk hierbij aan bomen en planten die van het terrein verdwijnen. Eenmaal werd een toiletpot uit het hokje meegenomen. Een ander probleem is dat sommige mensen uit de wijk zich stukken terrein van de school proberen toe te eigenen. De muur is dus hard nodig.
We zoeken nog deelnemers en sponsors. Als je op 1 september 2009 minimaal 16 jaar oud bent en interesse hebt je vakantie een keer te gebruiken om in El Seibo de mensen uit de sloppenwijk te helpen, neem dan gerust contact met ons op.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:44.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NVT","jcbos@solcon.nl","","519480767","","","Seibo Werkgroep Putten","","None","104","2009-01-13","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Wij hebben vanaf de oprichting  o.a. twee openbare toiletten gebouwd(in Afife en een in Abutia Kloe). Een kinderdagverblijf in Abutia Kloe. Geld geleend aan vrouwen in Afife. Een school gerenoveerd in Ve deme. Thans wordt er een kliniek in Wobe en een lagere school in Vedeme gebouwd. In April van dit jaar hebben we dankzij de kinderen van de Stelaertschool in Tilburg drie scholen en een kliniek van watertanks kunnen voorzien en van schriften en voetbalshirts.  We werken altijd nauw samen met een -al dan niet geformaliseerde -Ghanese organisatie. Ook werken we nauw samen met de lokale autoriteiten in een dorp(de Chief  en andere belangrijke mensen,al naar gelang  het project nodig heeft.) Hierdoor is het project echt van het betrokken dorp en is het geen Witte  olifants project, zoals dat in Ghana wordt genoemd of ook wel: White man's project. Sinds vorig jaar hebben we een Ierse Nederlander bereid gevonden voor ons als projectleider in Ghana op te treden. Gevolgen: project is in de geplande periode klaar, binnen de begroting gebleven en iedere maand een (in excel)financieel overzicht.

HIRDA stands for Himilo Relief and Development Association. Himilo means “vision” in Somali. HIRDA is a non-profit organization founded at The Hague in 1998 by members of the Somali Diaspora in the Netherlands. HIRDA works with other organizations to find lasting solutions to poverty and suffering in Somalia, particularly the South and Central regions.

In addition, HIRDA acts as a bridge between local communities and international donor organizations and mobilizes the Diaspora to engage in the development of their country of origin. Since its formation, HIRDA has become one of the leading migrant organizations in the Netherlands working on development issues.


The core of HIRDA’s mission is to improve the well-being of the needy people living in Somalia through the:

Creation of equal educational opportunities for boys and girls
Promotion of gender equality and women empowerment
Mobilization of relief services for refugees and people in disaster areas
Promotion of income-generating activities
Promotion of intercommunity social engagements
Mobilizing the Diaspora in the development of the region
HIRDA’s values are founded on its commitment to the people of Somalia and the motivation to succeed in improving the region, while maintaining an open mind regarding the variety of methods of achieving this success. The organization is politically neutral and does not discriminate. These values are reflected in the organization’s strategy and by the organization’s staff and management team.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","27172167","","ABN-AMRO BANK","628887310","NL94ABNA0628887310","","HIRDA","REMBRANDTWEG 6","Netherlands","1588","2012-07-18","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De Kwagala Foundation is een nieuwe organisatie voor internationale samenwerking. We ondersteunen maatschappelijke en sociale projecten in ontwikkelingslanden en organiseren in Nederland activiteiten om deze projecten financieel te kunnen ondersteunen.
De Kwagala Foundation richt zich op kinderen die, om welke reden dan ook, geen kind kunnen zijn. We zetten ons speciaal in voor lichamelijk en/of verstandelijk beperkte kinderen in ontwikkelingslanden. Zij worden vaak vergeten, weggestopt en aan hun lot overgelaten.

De aanleiding van het ontstaan van deze organisatie was de grote noodzaak om een brug te slaan tussen de Burundese diaspora in Nederland en brede groepen in de Nederlandse samenleving. Als middel zagen wij het gebruik van de cultuur om mensen dichter bij elkaar te brengen.
Vanuit de wens om een bijdrage te leveren aan een betere integratie van Burundese migranten in Nederland hebben wij een aantal activiteiten georganiseerd, waarbij deze groep regelmatig in contact kwam met autochtone Nederlanders en andere bevolkingsgroepen. Dit om de sociale cohesie te vergroten. 
Naast de integratie van Burundese migranten in Nederland, werken wij aan projecten om te vechten tegen de armoede in Burundi, zoals de bouw van een school voor beter onderwijs in Kiremba (Nyundo).
Stichting Umubano heeft drie bestuursleden en vijf vrijwilligers. Zij is verantwoordelijk voor de activiteiten in Nederland en verzamelt geld en middelen om ADPR te steunen. ADPR is verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie en uitvoering van de projecten in Burundi.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:31.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KVK nummer: 24366309","k.umubano@hotmail.com","","416833551","","","Stg.umubano","","South Sudan","281","2009-10-01","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Na thuiskomst besloot Anne wat terug te gaan doen.  Bij toeval (of niet?) arriveerde er kort daarna een brief vanuit de school met het verzoek om te helpen met het bouwen van schoolbanken. Sindsdien ondersteunt Stichting Anne in Afrika de lokale bevolking met de realisatie van goede initiatieven in Tanzania, gericht op het verbeteren van de kwaliteit van leven van kinderen. De geboden ondersteuning bestaat uit concrete materialen, zoals schoolspullen, een generator, of een windmolen die stroom verschaft aan het opvanghuis voor kinderen die in de gevangenis van Arusha worden geboren. 

Stichting Anne in Afrika spaart sinds 2008 voor kinderen die wees zijn geworden omdat hun ouders aan AIDS overleden zijn. Deze kinderen kunnen nu nog naar school op het New Hope Education Centre, een lokale NGO. Maar de klaslokalen van deze school worden gehuurd, en sinds de verdubbeling in huurprijs vorig jaar zijn de lokalen onbetaalbaar geworden. Zonder eigen school zal het New Hope Education Centre ophouden te bestaan, wat letterlijk betekent dat de weeskinderen op straat komen te staan. Daarom is Stichting Anne in Afrika bezig geweest met de aankoop van een stuk grond om een eigen school voor het New Hope Education Centre op te kunnen bouwen. Dit proces verliep moeizaam, maar inmiddels is het New Hope Education Centre de trotse eigenaar van een prachtig stuk grond van 4,5 acre! De komende tijd wordt stukje bij beetje de nieuwe school gebouwd, beginnend met een groot hek om het land ter bescherming van de bouwmaterialen en later de kinderen op de school. Na het hek volgen de klaslokalen, slaapvertrekken, keuken, groentetuin, etc. Zodra de benodigde fondsen binnen zijn, wordt gestart met de bouw. Uiteindelijk gaat de school plaats bieden aan 280 kinderen. De vorderingen zijn oa te volgen via www.anneinafrika.info. 

Stichting Anne in Afrika maakt een kleine 100 Euro kosten per jaar. Dit zijn kosten voor de Kamer van Koophandel en het hebben van een bankrekening. Eenieder die zich inzet voor Stichting Anne in Afrika doet dit geheel kosteloos en belangeloos. Stichting Anne in Afrika heeft geen strijkstok.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KVK nummer 34269219","stichtinganneinafrika@hotmail.com","ING","5081831","","","Stichting Anne in Afrika","Wilhelminastraat 10","Netherlands","778","2010-11-12","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Met een viertal bestuursleden, waaronder Marieke zelf, worden er door deze stichting fondsen geworven in Nederland om kwetsbare kinderen via een goede opvang een beter bestaan en toekomst te kunnen bieden. 

In mei 2010 is het weeshuis opgeleverd en zijn er 22 kinderen opgenomen. Dit gebeurt d.m.v. samenwerking en goed overleg met de kinderbescherming aldaar.

Onze visie:
Wij willen kansarme kinderen van het platteland in Kenia gelijke kansen bieden om op te groeien als volwassenen met een toekomst. Daarmee willen wij ons steentje bijdragen aan het verwerkelijken van de millenniumdoelen die door de Verenigde Naties zijn geformuleerd. 

Doelstellingen:
Ons doel met het Upendo 'Kanshuis' is:
- Kansarme kinderen van 3-6 jaar in dagopvang kleuteronderwijs te bieden als voorbereiding op de basisschool. Zij ontvangen 2 maaltijden per dag, een goede basis voor de gezondheid en voor de sociaal-emotionele ontwikkeling.
- De alleenstaande moeders van de kinderen zodanig te ondersteunen dat zij beter in het levensonderhoud van hun gezin kunnen voorzien.
- Kinderen die niemand meer hebben om voor ze te zorgen een liefdevol thuis, een goede verzorging en onderwijs te bieden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:39.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvKnr: 27299642","","Rabobank","131773429","NL41RABO0131773429","RABONL2U","Stichting Daraja for Children","Postbus 11695","Netherlands","702","2010-09-19","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Stichting Umeebee is sinds 2007 actief in Nederland en Zuid-Afrika an richt zich voornamelijk op jongeren. In Nederland richt Umeebee zich vooral op voorlichting en fondsenwerving. Dit wordt uitgevoerd door Frerieke van Bree (project coordinator ZA) en Eline Elias (project coordinator NL). 

In Zuid Afrika werken we samen met de Zuid Afrikaanse NGO SERI. Project coordinator Frerieke, die sinds 2006 in Zuid Afrika woont, leerde de oprichters van SERI in Zuid Afrika kennen in 2007. SERI heeft lokaal diverse projecten die zij financieel en inhoudelijk ondersteunen, waaronder het Centre of Science and Technology (COSAT). COSAT is een middelbare school (180 studenten), die al 10 jaar lang succesvol studenten uit onderontwikkelde gebieden educatie aanbiedt. De activiteiten die Stichting Umeebee aanbiedt vallen buiten het curriculum en zijn gestart door stichting Umeebee in samenwerking met SERI in 2008 als respons op het hoge uitval percentage van COSAT studenten uit universiteiten. De 'leadership' activiteiten (zelfvertrouwen opbouwen, presentaties doen) in combinatie met de online media (je stem laten horen) geven de Zuid Afrikaanse studenten de mogelijkheid om een persoonlijke groei te ervaren en zich zekerder op de toekomstige universiteit te voelen.

Back then, we were part of another NGO called Give a Child a Family, but over time the operations grew too big and it became necessary to find a new home for them.

Sivakamavalli am the Secretary of WORD. In the year 1991, I took a conscious decision to start a non governmental organization, one that will focus on women and their rights. The reason for this was that right from  the late 1980's I was part of a movement of a small group of young women inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s Bhoodan Movement. This movement was at the forefront of the protests that were organized to protest against the discrimination and marginalization of women on the basis of sex and female infanticide in villages and semi urban centers in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu. 

Today I have the immense satisfaction of having brought about lasting changes in the lives of women in the target areas where we work. I have 22 years less to worry about yet there seems so much more needs to be done if women are to really know the meaning of freedom, more so in rural areas. The current project is one more step in that direction.


My highest priority is to reach vulnerable communities, particularly in rural areas, which  are excluded from access to education, healthcare and sustainable livelihoods. I support them without regard to, religion, caste or political persuasion. Human dignity is our goal: a world where all can share the God-given benefits of the earth in security and without fear for the future.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:55.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered under the Tamil Nadu societies act 27 of 1975, Registration No. 39 of 1991","","Indian Bank (Branch Code V017)","509130602","","IDIBINBBCBE","Women’s Organization for Rural Development (WORD)","Velur Branch, No.75/1/F10 Bye pass Road, Velur - 638182, P.

Peru (naschoolse opvang), Guatamala (een niet- commercieel radio opleidingscentrum voor maya´s) en Nepal (verkoop van o.a. produkten van een vrouwen collectief). Hierbij gaat de voorkeur uit om te werken met lokale initiatiefnemers. Op deze manier proberen we een bijdrage te leveren aan het vervullen van de essentiële behoeften van een kind, zoals voeding, educatie en geborgenheid. Met uiteindelijk doel het kind zichzelf te laten zijn met uitzicht op een betere toekomst. Tevens hebben wij een webshop waarin fairtrade artikelen worden verkocht. Door de inkoop steunen wij groepen vrouwen en de extra winst na verkoop wordt weer geïnvesteerd in de projecten.

De stichting is opgericht eind 2007 n.a.v. een reis die ik samen met partner maakte door Tibet en Nepal en we erachter kwamen dat het een wens van ons beiden was om ons op deze manier in te zetten voor kinderen in de landen waar we gereisd hebben en die de kans niet krijgen om te leren, goed te eten en of goed onderdak te krijgen door gebrek aan financiële middelen.

Direct zijn er bij de organisatie in Nederland 6 mensen bij betrokken.

When we need a better nose for tracking smelly things we use dogs. They do the job very well but
unfortunately training them is very expensive and as dogs can be used to detect Tubercolosis  in people somebody came with the brialliant idea to look one step smaller: Rats.
http://blog.ted.com/2010/12/02/how-i-taught-rats-to-sniff-out-land-mines-bart-weetjens-on-ted-com/
Bart Weetjes made Rats sniff landmines, but also Tuberculosis, which is a disease that still effects millions on this planet and that is costly to diagnose.
We decided that we could take this on step furtherand look even smaller: Yeast!
We want to 'train' a microbe to detect smells and we have developed a clever way to get this done. We will do this as a part of the iGEM project. A match in synthetic biology in which university students are stimulated to think of novel applications of this technology and actually develop it. Using Yeast to sense disease looks very promosing to
us and if it works it could really mean a lot. With funds we want to buy much needed materials for our laboriatory that we need to do this specific research. If we have more funds we could expand our system to more smells and in the end our dream is to make a full yeast nose, that can smell anything we want it to.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:01.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Our project has no legal status, but for affairs we use the structure of the TU Delft Holding BV.

Door middel van nieuwsbriefprogramma's leren ze kritisch en zelfstandig na te denken, zelf beslissingen te nemen, meningen te vormen en die ook te uiten. De nadruk ligt op oplossingsgericht denken. Daarom begint elk FairPen nieuwsbrief project met een vraag of probleemstelling, waarnaar ze onderzoek doen, meningen over vormen en waar ze oplossingen voor bedenken. Op deze manier beklijft Informatie over thema's als armoedebestrijding, HIV/Aids, kinderarbeid of gezondheid beter dan in welk voorlichtingsprogramma dan ook. Ook leren ze in het project creatief denken, samenwerken, vragen (durven te) stellen, organiseren, structureren en leidinggeven.

Havonos doet dit door het bieden van structurele hulp op agrarisch, educatief en sociaal gebied. Het doel is het verbeteren van de levensstandaard en het verhogen van de zelfredzaamheid van de plaatselijke bevolking, zodat een situatie ontstaat waarin ontwikkeling mogelijk is. Havonos is een fondsenwervende instelling met een bestuur bestaande uit 5 personen, een comité van aanbeveling en veel vrijwilligers (23). Havonos werkt nauw samen met partnerorganisatie SAC (Social Action Committee), een stichting aldaar, opgericht door Pastor Gunam, welke stichting evenals Havonos, volkomen neutraal zonder enige politieke of religieuze binding, hulp biedt. Stichting Havonos heeft er voor gekozen om zich samen met het SAC op een aantal concrete projecten te richten. Momenteel zijn dit een naaimachineproject voor vrouwen (aanvraag bij de 1%CLUB) en de bouw van o.a. een toiletunit, de renovatie en inrichting van een school(deze aanvraag ligt bij NCDO). Inmiddels heeft stichting Havonos al ondersteuning mogen ontvangen van diverse Nederlandse organisaties en hiermee een substantiële bijdrage geleverd aan de reeds geboekte successen. Voor meer informatie verwijzen wij u graag naar onze website: www.havonos.nl. Beide stichtingen werken volkomen belangeloos, op vrijwillige basis, dus zonder enige betaling.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:58.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting KVK nr. 05077573","sieni@havonos.nl","Rabo Bank","120618923","","","Havonos","Domineeskamp 3","Netherlands","1435","2012-04-04","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Het was zo ontroerend om te merken hoe dankbaar de schoolleiding was en zag ook hoe hard zij hulp nodig hadden. Ik ben daarom een donatie actie gestart onder mijn vrienden en kennisen en heb totaal  €500 opgehaald en kunnen schenken aan de school. Hiermee konden de rekeningen betaald worden, nieuw schoolmateriaal worden aangeschaft en een begin worden gemaakt voor een potje voor de nieuwe school.  Ik wilde graag nog meer voor ze doen bij terugkomst, vandaar de 1 procent club.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:24.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","privee persoon","barbararink@gmail.com","","489050581","","","Barbara Rink","","None","214","2009-07-11","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

CAHF werkt samen met de stichting Toza Tabiat in Oezbekistan, en zamelt middels allerlei activiteiten geld in voor een drinkwaterproject. CAHF heeft ook een (web-) winkel: Uzned Trading Co., en verkoopt Oezbeeks handwerk ten bate van dit drinkwaterproject.
 Toza Tabiat is een milieu-organisatie, die wij hebben helpen oprichten. Toza Tabiat is in 2003 opgericht en gevestigd in Buchara, Oezbekistan. Toza Tabiat heeft de behoeften onder de bevolking van de dorpen onderzocht, en de prioriteiten vastgesteld. Daaruit is de noodzaak van een betrouwbare drinkwatervoorziening als eerste uit de bus gekomen.Toza Tabiat voert ons project uit. CAHF zorgt ervoor dat op tijd geld wordt overgemaakt. Het contact van CAHF met haar partner-organisatie Toza Tabiat gaat via jaarlijkse bezoeken aan en overleg over ons project, telefonisch contact en via e-mail.
Zowel CAHF als Toza Tabiat werkt onbezoldigd.
De controle op de besteding van het geld wat Toza Tabiat krijgt toegestuurd, wordt uitgevoerd door de bank, Asaka Bank in Buchara, i.s.m. de Oezbeekse overheid in Tashkent. Dit is een anti-terrorisme maatregel, om zeker te zijn dat het geld ook wordt besteed aan het doel waarvoor het is gestuurd. Ons doel is goedgekeurd door het ministerie in Tashkent. CAHF stuurt het geld op per afgesloten (deel-)contract, dus niet per onderdeel. Asaka Bank heeft een kopie van elk contract wat tussen CAHF en Toza Tabiat is afgesloten, en betaalt de rekeningen van Toza Tabiat, conform de inhoud van het betreffende (deel-)contract. Toza Tabiat kan geen contant geld opnemen.

Hiervoor heeft zij een opleidingscentrum voor algemene geneeskunde en verloskunde opgericht.
De organisatie is opgericht door vier enthousiaste medici – Reuben Waswa, Julius Maina, Kenneth Ireri en Marianne Darwinkel. Alle vier zijn zij al jaren werkzaam in het medische zorgverlening en het medisch onderwijs . Zij hebben hun krachten gebundeld om  in staat te zijn op een duurzame manier kwalitatief goed medisch onderwijs aan te bieden. Marianne als tropenarts, de andere drie als clinical officer met verschillende vervolgopleidingen. Waswa, Maina en Marianne hebben gemiddeld meer dan 10 jaar ervaring in medisch onderwijs in Kenia op verschillende scholen en aan verschillende faculteiten. Naast training van studenten hebben de drie ook veel aan training van onderwijzers gedaan. Daarnaast hebben zij vele jaren patiëntenzorg verleend en hebben zowel Ireri als Maina een succesvolle medische praktijk aan de Keniase kust. Alle vier de initiatiefnemers zijn betrokken bij de algemene planning en activiteiten van de organisatie. Marianne is de overall manager van de diverse activiteiten, Waswa is actief in de ontwikkeling van de opleidingen en alle andere academische activiteiten, Maina eveneens met de academische activiteiten alsook de bouw. Ireri is betrokken bij alle processen, maar zijn rol zal meer groter worden op het moment dat de gezondheidszorg verlening van start gaat (gedurende het eerste  leerjaar van de eerste groep studenten). 
De organisatie is bezig op eigen locatie de school en het gezondheidscentrum op te bouwen. Daarnaast gaat op 10 september 2012 de opleiding tot clinical officer van start  in klaslokalen van een nabijgelegen college.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:21.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Ltd. - CPR/2009/5752","info@chpkenya.org","ABN AMRO","566794721","","","CHPK North Coast Medical Training College","MTWAPA","Netherlands","1642","2012-08-24","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Hierbij gaat de voorkeur uit om te werken met lokale initiatiefnemers. Op deze manier proberen we een bijdrage te leveren aan het vervullen van de essentiële behoeften van een kind, zoals voeding, educatie en geborgenheid. Met uiteindelijk doel het kind zichzelf te laten zijn met uitzicht op een betere toekomst. Tevens hebben wij een webshop waarin fairtrade artikelen worden verkocht. Door de inkoop steunen wij groepen vrouwen en de extra winst na verkoop wordt weer geïnvesteerd in de projecten.

Wij ondersteunen momenteel een naschoolse opvang in Peru en een non-commercieel radio opleidingscentrum voor Maya´s in Guatemala en verkopen o.a. produkten van een vrouwen collectief in Nepal. Het kinderdagverblijf in Guatemala zal een nieuw te ondersteunen project zijn. Zo zorgen we nu voor een maandelijkse bijdrage voor de oprichter en uitvoerder van het Maya-radiostation, dit heeft hij nu nog nodig voor zijn levensonderhoud en dat van zijn gezin, om zijn werk voor te kunnen zetten. Voor de naschoolse opvang zorgen we dat de kinderen een maaltijd kunnen krijgen, jassen, medicijnen en bv knutselmateriaal.

De stichting is opgericht eind 2007 n.a.v. een reis die ik samen met partner maakte door Tibet en Nepal en we erachter kwamen dat het een wens van ons beiden was om ons op deze manier in te zetten voor kinderen in de landen waar we gereisd hebben en die de kans niet krijgen om te leren, goed te eten en of goed onderdak te krijgen door gebrek aan financiële middelen.

Direct zijn er 6 mensen bij de stichting in Nederland betrokken. Ik en mijn partner zijn initiatiefnemers en doen al het werk, om ons heen hebben we een bestuur bestaande uit 4 mensen en los daaromheen kunnen we rekenen op vrienden die vrijwillig ons helpen tijdens festivals, benefiet of andere werkzaamheden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:27.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","officiële stichting met een notariële akte en KVK nummer 34280750.

werd opgericht door in Nederland wonende Somaliërs. Samen met anderen werkt HIRDA aan duurzame oplossingen om de armoede en het lijden in Somalië terug te dringen. Daarbij ligt het accent op Zuid- en Centraal-Somalië, waar het 20 jaar durende burgeroorlog het meest effect heeft gehad. 
HIRDA vervult ook een brugfunctie tussen plaatselijke gemeenschappen en internationale donororganisaties. In de jaren na 1998 heeft HIRDA zich ontwikkeld tot een van de belangrijkste migrantenorganisaties voor ontwikkelingszaken in Nederland. Sinds 2009 maakt HIRDA deel uit van een alliantie onder leiding van Oxfam Novib, die de deur opent naar structurele financiering voor vijf jaar van een deel van een programma voor educatie en versterking van de positie van vrouwen in Somalië.
HIRDA heeft vele uiteenlopende projecten – waarbij Onderwijs, met nadruk op onderwijs voor meisjes, een belangrijk speerpunt is. HIRDA’s focus gebieden zijn:

In de sloppenwijken van Nairobi zijn honger en gebrek aan onderwijs en medische zorg een onderdeel van het dagelijks leven. De meeste bewoners hebben geen uitzicht op een betere toekomst en alcohol- en drugsverslaving en hiv/aids zijn aan de orde van de dag. Het zal dan ook niemand verbazen dat hier veel kinderen op straat leven omdat ze wees zijn of door hun ouders worden verwaarloosd.

Wat wel verbazend is, is hoe weerbaar, speels en levenslustig deze kinderen zijn. Het zijn gewone, leuke, normale kinderen die onze hulp nodig hebben.

Twintig kinderen

Patricia Mukolwe woont zelf in Soweto Kayole. Zij heeft zich het lot van deze kinderen aangetrokken en startte samen met haar vader in 2007 Matunda Orphans’ Community Center. De naam Matunda is Swahili voor fruit en symboliseert de gevarieerde en kleurrijke, maar kwetsbare groep kinderen die Patricia onder haar hoede heeft. Intussen hebben rond de twintig kinderen in de leeftijd van drie tot zestien jaar een tweede thuis gevonden bij Matunda.

Opvang

De kinderen worden in het centrum opgevangen door Patricia en de andere vrijwilligers. Zij hebben echter weinig financiële middelen en kunnen de kinderen niet elke dag van een goede maaltijd voorzien, om van medische zorg en scholing nog maar niet te spreken. Wel geven ze opvang, een luisterend oor, een steuntje in de rug en als dat nodig is.
Zo helpt Patricia ook kinderen die hiv-positief zijn of geen slaapplaats hebben om hun weg te vinden binnen de bevoegde instanties.

Om haar en deze kinderen te helpen is het project Matunda opgezet.

Een helpende hand

Tijdens onze bezoeken aan Kenia zijn wij in Nairobi met Patricia in contact gekomen. Wij waren erg onder de indruk van wat zij, ondanks haar beperkte middelen, voor deze kinderen doet. Haar betrokkenheid is erg groot, maar zelf is zij financieel niet in staat meer vorm te geven aan dit project. Op deze manier hopen wij haar de steun te geven die zij en de kinderen verdienen, zodat zowel de kinderen als Matunda straks op eigen benen kunnen staan en een gezonde toekomst tegemoet gaan.

Maar daarvoor hebben we ook uw hulp nodig!

Mogen wij op u rekenen?

Namens Patricia en de kinderen:

Door de samenwerking met de kloosterorde, 
“Las Hijas de Nuestra Señora de La Piedad”, is er voortdurend contact over de lopende projecten. De zusters coördineren de projecten en koppelen dit terug naar de Stichting.  Daarnaast kunnen wij er zeker van zijn dat het geld dat we overmaken voor 100% aan een project besteed wordt. 

Onze voorzitster Femke Arends is, als vrijwilligerster, geregeld in Peru om de projecten te bezoeken, voorlichting te geven en om te helpen waar nodig is.

In 2006-2007 heeft de Stichting Mariposa-Peru in samenwerking met de kloosterorde ""Las Hijas de Nuestra Senora de La Piedad"",  het project Maura succesvol afgerond. ( zie nieuwsbrief Januari 2007 op onze website)

In december 2006 en 2007 financieerde de Stichting Mariposa-Peru kerstfeesten in Peru.  De jerstfeesten werden door de kloosterorde georganiseerd voor arme kinderen in Peru.

Stichting Mheer voor Fako is ontstaan na een bezoek aan Fako in 2006. Reden van dit bezoek was een familiebezoek voor Lambert.  De ouders van Lambert Jongnain zijn geboren en getogen in Fako, Kei-Besar (Molukken) Na een gesprek met de leerkrachten aldaar is de nood van de niet schoolgaande kinderen besproken. In Indonesië is een schooluniform verplicht en veel ouders of verzorgers van kinderen in schoolgaande leeftijd kunnen dit niet betalen. Bij thuiskomst hebben Lambert en Josée een actie opgezet om geld bij elkaar te krijgen voor 45 schooluniformen voor kinderen van Fako waardoor zij het basisonderwijs konden volgen. Na deze actie is stichting Mheer voor Fako opgericht en hebben wij reeds meerdere projecten op onze naam staan. Na de aanschaf van de 45 schooluniformen hadden wij de vraag gekregen voor de bouw van een lerarenlokaal en toiletten. Doordat er niet 100 maar 145 kinderen naar school gingen, was de school te klein vandaar de aanvraag voor dit extra lokaal. Toiletten waren voorheen niet aanwezig (kinderen en leerkrachten gingen naar het strand om hun behoeften te doen) en leveren nu een betere hygiëne op waardoor er minder ziektes zijn en minder lesuitval.
Daarna hebben wij ons ingezet om de oude school die na een zware storm flink beschadigd was te renoveren. Vooral het dak was zwaar beschadigd maar ook de rest van de school had een renovatiebeurt nodig. Dit project heeft ook bij de 1% club gestaan en is nu afgerond. Na dit project hebben Lambert en Josée het project van de aanleg van een schoolplein van dichtbij gevolgd omdat zij 5 maanden in Fako verbleven. Ook dit project is afgerond.
Tijdens dit verblijf hebben wij met veel mensen gesproken over eventuele nieuwe projecten. Hierbij is ook het contact ontstaan met mvr. Eusebia (Eby) Renwarin die kleinschalig weduwvrouwen helpt met kleine tuin projecten.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:20.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting Mheer voor Fako

Mafubira Parish, Mafubira sub- County , Jinja District , Uganda would like
your help. we are working to provide education support for needy orphans
and vulnerable children (OVCs) whose parents have died of HIV/AIDS and the
war conflict in the region, as many of them are now returning to their
homes from Right now the project needs to find funding to support
approximately 126 orphans to local schools for education. This initiative
is under the organization , which is a locally registered community based
organization-CBO at jinja District , Uganda . The REG NO , 122032

THE BACKGROUND
The HIV/AIDS, epidemic is contributing to rapid break downs of existing
structures that traditionally took care of development of orphans and other
vulnerable children . it has deprived many Ugandan children of critical
resources required to provide their basic developmental needs An increasing
number of HIV/AIDS orphans and other vulnerable children is denied the
opportunity to start and continue schooling . The majority of those who do
so are entering and staying at school with preventable physical and
emotional problems that teachers are unequipped to handle . malnutrition ,
poor health ,social exclusion , lack of early mental stimulation resulting
from inadequate care , all effect the child's ability to think , learn and
function effectively . more than anyone else , young children are the
greatest victims as they are more vulnerable than older children to
disease , malnutrition , and unmet psychosocial needs critical to
socialization and survival .support is necessary to enable caring family to
provide basic resources , care and support to orphans and vulnerable
children

OUR aim is to support girls education and empower them by providing orphans quality education, create opportunity to get them jobs and enable
them to fight for their rights and make them a respectable sign for Global
Peace .

; VISION:
A sustainable society where individuals promote safe behavior, individual
responsibility, and demonstrate the ability to contribute to the efforts of
their communities to realize our mission.

Mission:
we exist to facilitate an African children , Christian response to meet the
needs of those who have been affected by Epidemics by overcoming the
causes , effects , and spread of diseases through educating
orphans ,disease awareness and sensitization mobile clinics , empowerment
programs and community capacity building in light of Epidemics and

Via de Stichting Haarlem-Mutare Stedenband werkten Jansje Meijman en Joyce Timmerman in 2007 en 2009 aan een community-theatervoorstelling in Zimbabwe. Dit werd ondersteund door HIVOS Harare. Ook gaven zij lessen aan Mutarese leerkrachten die theaterlessen aan hun klas wilden gaan geven. 

Jansje en Joyce kwamen in Mutare in aanraking met ICHYPPA (www.ichyppa.tk), een lokale stichting van verschillende Mutarese kunstenaars die elke zaterdag gratis kunst-trainingen geven aan de kinderen in de verschillende townships, zoals theater en dans. Vanwege de economische situatie en het gebrek aan onderwijs, vond ICHYPPA het belangrijk om kinderen een plek te bieden waar hun stem gehoord zou worden en waar ze hun talenten konden ontwikkelen. ICHYPPA bestaat sinds 2008 en telt inmiddels 400 leerlingen verspreid over 4 townships. ICHYPPA traint kunstenaars om les te geven in hun vakgebied en in hun township. Samen met de oprichters van ICHYPPA, Allen Mapingure en Henry Tsopotsa, maakten Jansje en Joyce theaterplannen voor 2010. Dit verbond werd 'BIRD&FISH' gedoopt; de vogel is het nationaal symbool van Zimbabwe, en de vis staat voor de bijzondere relatie van Nederland met de zee. 

BIRD&FISH zal in 2010 verschillende, verfrissende theaterprojecten voor en met kinderen en jongeren doen in Mutare, Zimbabwe. BIRD&FISH inspireert jongeren tot het maken van eigen keuzes en het geloven in je eigen talenten. BIRD&FISH traint theaterdocenten, regisseurs en acteurs in Zimbabwe.

Catharinafonds is opgericht in 2002, door Piet en Ria Dekker, om bij te dragen aan de ontwikkelingskansen van Keniaanse kinderen en vooral meisjes. In eerste instantie werd een weeshuis gesteund nabij Nairobi (het Mother Mercy Home), maar sinds enkele jaren ondersteunen we vooral het onderwijs in Namanga District, Zuid-Kenia, op de grens van Tanzania. Daar wonen vooral nomadische Massai, die traditioneel weinig onderwijs genieten. Vooral door de veranderende omstandigheden (klimaat/droogt, landverdeling) ontstaat hier steeds meer behoefte aan scholing om nieuw perspectief te creëren.  
In Nederland werkt de vrijwilligersorganisatie Catharinafonds Nederland, die fondsen werft voor de project in Kenia. Hiermee zijn 5 bestuursleden en 10 vrijwilligers actief, naast vele familieleden en relaties. In Kenia werkt de NGO Catharina Foundation Kenya,  gevormd door 4 vrijwillige bestuursleden, en is een Operationele Organisatie actief die de projecten coördineert en mede uitvoert, bestaande uit twee deeltijd betaalde krachten, een bouwcoördinator en een scholingscoördinator. 
In de periode zijn vele klaslokalen gerealiseerd (bij elkaar 15), zijn drie Special Needs Units gebouwd, is veel aandacht besteed aan water en voedsel en keukens/stoves, zijn schoolboeken en ander leermateriaal verzorgd.  Ook is veel aandacht besteed aan  oudervoorlichting en bevordering van community awareness en is actief geïnvesteerd in opbouw van relaties met locale leiders. Momenteel worden 5 lokalen gerealiseerd, wordt in Namanga een bibliotheek gebouwd, en wordt een meisjeshuis gebouwd bij een van de scholen, Enoosampurumpurr. Bij deze school werken we ook aan het mogelijk maken van zonne-energie-opwekking en zijn nu eerste zonnepanelen geïnstalleerd ( zie  http://catharinafondskenia.mambapoint.tv).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:59.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting KvK 09128264","info@catharinafonds.nl","","P9318026","","","Catharinafonds","","None","358","2009-12-14","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Alex heeft zelf een groot deel van zijn jeugd op straat doorgebracht. Het centrum ontvangt momenteel meer dan 255 straatkinderen tussen de 2 en 16 jaar voor scholing. Het zijn kinderen die anders niet naar school kunnen gaan, omdat ze veelal geen ouders of opvoeders hebben die zich om hen bekommeren. Zonder het centrum met de school zijn de meeste kinderen aan een bedelaarbestaan zijn overgeleverd. 

De dagelijkse lessen worden gegeven door 11 leraren. Er wordt ook dagelijks lunch bereid door 4 koks: dit is voor de meeste kinderen hun enige maaltijd van de dag. De inzet van dit zeer gemotiveerde personeel, dat voor een onkostenvergoeding werkt, is bijzonder.  Voor de kinderen die 's nachts op straat moeten slapen worden opvanggezinnen in de buurt gezocht. Het zijn vaak arme gezinnen die zelf ook geen middelen hebben om straatkinderen te helpen, ze kunnen wel een slaapplaats bieden maar niet meer dan dat. Daarom is het zo belangrijk dat er dagopvang is. 

De kinderen leren lezen en schrijven, krijgen naai- en knutselles, maar ook ook 'life-skills' training om hen meer eigenwaarde bij te brengen. Het centrum draagt echt bij aan betere toekomstkansen voor de vele straat- en zwerfkinderen in Antanananarivo.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:03.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Association.

EM outras palavras, definindo a Ecoar, temos:
Ecoar is a living being. It is like someone that has traveled to so many places and by doing that has experienced life, interacting with people allover the globe. 
Ecoar is like someone that has been in the heart of other beings and being there was able to fell their comotion when they see, listen or feel something to which they identify, dream of.
We understand that to communicate, to express oneself is part of the intimate nature of everything that is alive. And by doing that, through the magic exitent in words, through music, through the visual arts and even through the uniqueness of our maners and glances, we are able to inspire everyone with our ideals, with our dreams. We are able to spread what we do and what we contribute to conquer the victory of having a more fulfilling and happy world.
That is Ecoar. Much more than being a communication enterprise, we understand that our mission is to contribute to a sustainable development in the most different sectors of human activity.
We believe that what you do, produce or sell should take along a message of ideals, values and should provide a unique experience to those that, like you, are identified with the living being that you have created – your enterprise, your work.
Along with Ecoar you can communicate that to everyone, since the nature of our work is what can join each and every one to you.
Ecoar.

Four volunteer board members handle most administrative tasks and numerous other volunteers from all over the world work on-site at our projects.  In addition, we have two volunteers who check references for all in-country volunteers and a volunteer recreational therapist who helps with activities planning.
We have built and are operating a kinder/ day care  for the children of poor families working in the pineapple fields and packing plants.  A healthy breakfast or snack is served every weekday.  The center also provides supportive childcare for single mothers who are struggling to work and care for young children.
Our role will be to generate enthusiasm within the community via our international volunteers and to provide support and guidance in regard to how to obtain materials.

Door middel van scholing in de vorm van bijvoorbeeld Engelse les, sport, spel, computerlessen en huiswerkbegeleiding wordt bijgedragen aan de ontwikkeling van kinderen die deze vormen van scholing anders nooit zouden krijgen.

Armoedebestrijding begint met scholing. De beste manier om armoede structureel op te lossen is door middel van goede scholing. Señor de Huanca draagt hier aan bij, door naast het bieden van een werkplek voor kinderen, en hulp te bieden bij het maken van hun huiswerk, ook zorgt voor lesmateriaal. De computers en printer zullen een grote bijdrage leveren aan de kwaliteit van scholing, doordat meer lesmateriaal aanwezig is in de vorm van gekopieerde boeken, en gebruik kan worden gemaakt van tekstverwerkers en internet door de scholieren.

Señor de Huanca is in 2001 opgericht door Marco en Frida Antonio. Dit is een Peruaans stel van ongeveer 40 jaar oud. Zij hebben dit project opgericht om kansarme kinderen in de wijk Santa Maria van Cusco, te helpen met hun schoolactiviteiten. Dit is de voornaamste reden, daarbij geldt dat het eigen gezin op dit moment een goed leven leidt voor Peruaanse begrippen en dat ze op deze manier wat terug willen doen voor de gemeenschap. Dit betreft voornamelijk huiswerkhulp, maar ook andere activiteiten die de persoonlijke groei van de kinderen helpt te stimuleren. Denk aan muziek, sport en spel. 
Er werken nu 2 leraressen standaard elke dag in het gebouw, die de kinderen helpen met hun huiswerk. Daarnaast komen Marco en Frida zelf ook regelmatig op het project.

Silent Work werkt aan:
· Schoon drinkwater
· Gezonde voeding
· Gezondheidszorg
· Onderwijs
· Werkgelegenheid
We nemen als Silent Work altijd hun hele verhaal in ogenschouw, zodat we niet één aspect van de situatie behartigen en andere belangrijke zaken buiten beschouwing laten. De goede volgorde is bij de opbouw heel belangrijk. Wij willen op deze wijze lokale initiatieven steunen. En het algemeen welzijn van de vergeten kinderen en volwassenen in Afrika bevorderen.

Wij hebben 5 bestuursleden en een tiental vrijwilligers. We werven geld voor projecten die vanuit Afrika worden aangevraagd. De stichting is opgericht in 1998 n.a.v. de oorlog in Rwanda. Daar was ik Wiljo Woodi Oosterom, (voorzitter Silent Work Nederland) ook betrokken bij. De vraag was toen om te helpen bij het bouwen van een school voor de door de genocide 850 dakloze en ouderloze kinderen en zo deze kinderen een aanspreekpunt tijdens de dag te geven. Huizen bouwen en ouderen zoeken om voor hen te zorgen was in die tijd onmogelijk. Voor deze aktie die veel groter was dan mijn voorgaande hulpverlening aan Afrika was het nodig een degelijke transparante stichting op te zetten. Wij proberen samen met de lokale bevolking door ondersteuning mensen uit de armoede sfeer te halen door duurzame projecten te starten en die 5 jaar te blijven volgen, zodat men daarna onafhankelijk is en dat zij zelf zorg voor elkaar kunnen dragen zonder hulp van buiten.

Ik, Wiljo Woodi Oosterom, werk 8 maanden van het jaar in Afrika samen met Demba Abou Bah voorzitter Silent Work West Afrika.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvK nr 37089439","silenwork@planet.nl","Rabobank","356918890","NL29RABO0356918890","","Silent Work","Edam","Netherlands","184","2008-03-14","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De stichting is ontstaan omdat ik, Anika de voorzitter van de stichting, al 5 maanden in Zuid-Afrika ben geweest om daar vrijwilligerswerk te doen. Nadat de organisatie waar ik was, failliet was gegaan wist ik dat ik een stichting moest opzetten voor de kinderopvang waar ik veel had gewerkt. De kinderopvang krijgt nu geen ondersteuning meer. Niet alleen geen hulp meer in het opvangen en verzorgen van de kinderen, maar ook geen hulp meer met het onderhoud van de kinderopvang zelf. 
In de tijd dat ik daar was heb ik een hechte vriendschap opgebouwd met Aaron Shozi. Hij was de chauffeur van de organisatie en is nu werkloos. Zij droom is om een winkel te hebben, voor een basisinkomen voor zichzelf. Maar ook om het in de community waar hij woont makkelijk te maken om boodschappen te doen. De meeste zijn namelijk uren onderweg. Met deze winkel is dat hoogstens nog 2 uur of korter. 
Kinderopvang Nqobile ligt in het gebied Shongweni Dam en de winkel van Aaron Shozi staat in het gebied Shongweni en ligt in de bergen. Beide liggen in Kwazulu Natal. Shongweni ligt ongeveer 30 minuten rijden vanaf het vliegveld in Durban.

Kinderopvang Nqobile heeft ondersteuning nodig bij het opknappen van de kinderopvang. Het is vervallen en veel dingen zijn kapot.

De winkel van Aaron Shozi heeft hulp nodig bij het opstarten. Er is geen geld aanwezig om de winkel te vullen met levensmiddelen. Ook is het handig voor de winkel van Aaron om een auto te hebben voor het inkopen van de spullen.

Er zijn grote plannen die de stichting heeft voor de toekomst. Zo wil de stichting op de grond van Aaron een opvang plaatsen voor zwerfkinderen en bij die opvang een leercentrum maken. Daar kunnen de kinderen en vak leren. En er kunnen 3 huizen gebouwd worden om zo 3 gezinnen onderdak te bieden en van de huur die ze betalen kan de winkel blijven draaien.
Ook wil de stichting een gehandicaptenopvang opzetten in de toekomst.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:51.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Kamer van Koophandel Hilversum

Stichting Local Dreamers is een organisatie geboren uit de pure passie van een aantal jonge idealisten voor Zuid-Amerika, en Ecuador in het bijzonder.
Wij zijn dromers. Een jong team, gepassioneerd, ambitieus en dynamisch. Iedere dag proberen we onze dromen met iedereen te delen. Dat doen we met veel energie en plezier, maar ook met een boodschap. Bijdragen aan een wereld waar mensen blij van worden. Beetje bij beetje.

Local Dreamers verandert acceptatie in ambitie. Gelatenheid in energie. Dromen in daden. Met de inzet van studenten, vrijwilligers en bedrijven stimuleren we lokale initiatieven in sociaal-economische achterstandsgemeenschappen. We creëren een inspirerende en zelfregulerende omgeving waarbinnen westerse avonturiers en de lokale bevolking van elkaar kunnen leren en met elkaar kunnen delen.

Enkele jaren geleden is Plenty Food opgericht door dierenvrienden die mensen willen helpen zonder dat het ten koste gaat van dieren.

PlentyFood bestaat in Nederland uit 4 bestuursleden die werken zonder salaris. Momenteel zijn we bezig met het project \""Vitagoat\"" in India.

Met de Vitagoat machine kan men zonder elektriciteit sojamelk maken. De machine wordt aangedreven door een fiets (vergelijk met een hometrainer). We werken via de Anganwadi Centra (een soort consultatiebureau\'s). Deze centra werven vrouwen die daar wonen voor de uitvoering. Deze zorgen voor de productie en verspreiding van de melk. 

We werken ook samen met Hart Jansson  van de organisatie Malnutrition Matters in India (en voor een ander project in Zuid-Afrika met Sampie en Susan Marais van \'SamSanSoya\'). Malnutrition werkt samen met de Wereldbank en de YES bank. Verder is een belangrijke partner Dr. Molwane from ICDS. Dat is de lokale overheid die verantwoordelijk is voor dit soort projecten, ze goedkeurt en ook geld geeft voor voedingssupplementen vanuit de Indiase overheid. 

Voor de uitvoering van het project wordt een SHG (Self Help Group) opgericht, een lokale organisatie die de Vitagoat soja melk gaat produceren. Als er al een goede non-profit instelling is in de buurt wordt gekeken of er samenwerking mogelijk is. De SHG (self help group) wordt opgericht daar waar het project van start gaat. 

Verder worden we soms geholpen door Pacotex en Alpro door adviezen en soms met een donatie.
De machine wordt uiteindelijk eigendom van Plenty Food.
 
De voedselprojecten zullen worden opgezet en ondersteund in gebieden, waar de nood het hoogst is. Ons uitgangspunt is dat bij het produceren van voedsel zo veel mogelijk het natuurlijke evenwicht tussen mens, plant en dier in stand wordt gehouden. Het gaat daarbij niet alleen om de landbouw maar ook om de leefomgeving als geheel. Ook door middel van voorlichting geven wij aandacht aan de vele aspecten die dit mogelijk kunnen maken.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:46.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Jolanda Buets en Simone Heemskerk zijn de drijvende krachten achter Por Eso!. Op dit moment hebben ze projecten in Guatemala en Peru. Het uiteindelijk doel: het welzijn en de zelfredzaamheid van de lokale bevolking vergroten. En dit kan zeker samen gaan met plezier en creativiteit. 

In Nederland worden zij ondersteunt door een enthousiaste groep van vrijwilligers die continu meedenkt en ook in actie komt en het werk van Por Eso! daar waar mogelijk voor het voetlicht brengt.  

In Guatamala loopt het moestuinconcept van Por Eso! voorspoedig. Het moestuinenconcept biedt een belangrijk antwoord op het vaak eenzijdige voedingspatroon en het tekort aan voedsel in de gemeenschappen waar Por Eso!  actief is. Maar PorEso! is reëel genoeg om ook verder binnen de gemeenschap te kijken en te luisteren en steun te bieden aan wensen waardoor de mensen een belangrijke stap kunnen maken. 

Por Eso!  initieert, neemt in eerste instantie de projectleiding en zorgt vanaf dag 1 ervoor dat de lokale gemeenschap samen beslissingen neemt, het werk verdeelt, de bouwstenen aanlevert en problemen onderweg oplost. Por Eso! draagt het project gaandeweg over zodat het de lokale mensen zich snel eigenaar voelen en de projecten zelfstandig kunnen voortbestaan. 

In Guatemala kunnen de projecten nu na een aantal jaar al op eigen benen staan. 
Hoog in de Andes in Peru hebben zij inmiddels het vertrouwen en draagvlak gewonnen van de lokale bevolking in een paar dorpen om samen met hen een moestuinproject bij de scholen te starten en de vrouwen te helpen met het verkrijgen van inkomsten uit hun weefwerk. 

Por Eso! is persoonlijk, klein en slagvaardig en streeft met een project - dat in geld en tijd te overzien is en snel tot resultaten komt -  een  grote impuls aan het welzijn van mensen in achterstandssituaties te geven. Samen met de lokale mensen zodat het resultaat ook blijvend is, ook nadat Por Eso! het  heeft overgedragen. 

Kijk ook eens op www.poreso.org en lees in de nieuwsbrieven over de lokale mensen en hun vooruitgang en bekijk de filmpjes die je even heel dichtbij het werk en de enorme energie die ervan uitgaat, brengen.

Ze kruipen met slippers aan hun handen door de straten van Bukoba of zitten te bedelen voor de winkels. Er is sprake van een hoge werkeloosheid onder de mensen met een handicap in Bukoba. Ze zijn laag opgeleid (de meerderheid heeft alleen de basisschool afgerond) en worden door werkgevers vaak als tweederangs burgers behandeld. De meeste mensen met een handicap in Bukoba verdienen op dit moment hun (lage) inkomens door het doen van kleine klusjes (bijvoorbeeld als schoenmaker) maar veelal door te bedelen op straat. Bukoba Disabled Assistance Project (BUDAP) is opgericht om mensen met een handicap in Bukoba in staat te stellen normaal te participeren in de samenleving.

Missie BUDAP
De missie van BUDAP is het terugdringen van de armoede onder mensen met een handicap in Bukoba. Empower de mensen met een handicap in Bukoba door ze te laten participeren in de samenleving en economie en hun eigen inkomen te laten genereren.

Visie BUDAP
BUDAP gelooft dat mensen met een handicap in Bukoba met een kleine ondersteuning als normale burgers kunnen participeren in de maatschappij. BUDAP creert een werkplaats waar groepen mensen met een handicap hun eigen business kunnen opzetten (trommelmakers, handicraftmakers, schoenmakers en kleermakers). De mensen zullen worden getraind waar nodig en worden ondersteund bij hun marketing activiteiten. De vervaardigde produkten worden verkocht in en buiten Tanzania.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:48.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Officieel geregistreerd in Bukoba Tanzania als NGO onder nummer 12323439394031","info@budap.org","","113784570","","","Bukoba Disabled Assistance Project","","None","111","2008-06-24","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Zo zijn er onder andere workshops in schrijven, muziekproducties maken, verhalen vertellen, films maken, beeldvorming en media-educatie.

 Tijdens die workshops laten we deelnemers werken met mensen die ze vaak niet echt goed kennen, zodat ze elkaar beter leren begrijpen. Zo helpen we mensen om zichzelf te laten horen. Kambisa! biedt een platform om jezelf te uiten, je werk te publiceren en met anderen te discussiëren. Op die manier wil Kambisa! nieuwe geluiden onder de aandacht brengen.

Stichting Young in Prison (YiP) komt op voor deze kinderen, zorgt ervoor dat ze zich kunnen ontwikkelen en dat ze persoonlijke begeleiding krijgen. Zo wordt de gevangenis weer een instelling voor rehabilitatie, in plaats van een ’school voor criminaliteit’. 

Succesvol reïntegreren lukt vooral als iedereen in de omgeving van de kinderen mee doet. Onze methodiek bestaat daarom uit drie fasen:

Fase I:
Deze fase is gericht op de kinderen. Onze programma’s bieden hoop en steun waardoor de mentaliteit op een structurele manier verandert. In deze fase zien de kinderen dat positief gedrag beloond wordt en dat samenwerking loont. Als een kind gemotiveerd is om te veranderen gaat deze door naar de volgende fase.

Fase II:
We zetten netwerken op met lokale organisaties. Er komen intensievere trainingen in de gevangenissen, gevolgd door begeleiding door een persoonlijke coach van de lokale organisatie. Deze fase is sterk resultaat gericht, vooral vanwege het naderende moment van terugkeer.

Fase III:
Na vrijlating komen de jongeren in een door Young in Prison gecoördineerd traject. Hierbij speelt het netwerk een cruciale rol vanwege de geïntegreerde benadering. Iedereen doet mee, van ziekenhuizen die bende tatoeages weghalen tot aan scholen en bedrijven die de in de gevangenis verworven vaardigheden verder willen opbouwen. Een persoonlijke coach biedt de kinderen ondersteuning bij hun terug keer in de maatschappij.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:12.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Onze ambitie is om op de lange termijn een positieve impact te creëren voor de natuur in relatie tot de lokale bevolking die daarvan afhankelijk is.

De WOL is opgericht in 1986 en in 1991 officieel een stichting geworden. De WOL ondersteunt vanaf 1988 ontwikkelingsprojecten in Burkina Faso. Vanaf 1995 werkt de WOL samen met een vaste partner in Burkina, de vereniging Développement Sans Frontière (DSF), waarvan de WOL medeoprichter is.
Onder de slogan 'Onderwijs voor Ontwikkeling / Eduquer pour Developper' voeren WOL en DSF actie om onderwijsontwikkelingsprojecten op te zetten.
De projecten van de WOL en DSF sluiten aan bij de nationale onderwijsprogramma’s van Burkina Faso en de internationale programma’s in het kader van het realiseren van de millenniumdoelen van de Verenigde Naties.

De stichting wil met onderwijs en onderdak de jongens op een praktische manier steunen bij het opbouwen van een menswaardig bestaan en het werken aan een betere toekomst.
Stichting Bolsward Sigoti heeft vanaf augustus 2005 geld ingezameld voor dit project. In totaal ontvingen zij ruim 150.000 euro, inclusief subsidies van Wilde Ganzen en NCDO, Nationale Commissie voor Duurzame Ontwikkelings-samenwerking. Met dit geld werd in Sigoti de basisschool voor 320 kansarme jongens gebouwd. Op de school zullen de kinderen gratis onderwijs krijgen. Ook zal de school tijdelijk onderdak bieden aan dakloze leerlingen. Stichting Bolsward Sigoti is nu bezig met fondsenwerven voor de volgende fase van het project: de bouw van een onderdak.

Center 2 ontleent zijn specifieke ervaring uit een eerder langdurig werkverband met een Nederlandse organisatie. 

Het doel van CSVN is om weggevallen hulp weer op het oude niveau terug te brengen: 400 tot 500 operaties per jaar aan lichamelijk gehandicapte kinderen in (Noord-)Vietnam.
Zet daartoe uitsluitend en alleen Vietnamese medewerkers in.
Werkt in veraf gelegen gebieden: de meest kanslozen eerst.
Maakt gebruik van een gespecialiseerd mobiel operatieteam.

Center 2 zet veelal een mobiel specialisten team in, deze komen o.a. van het Nationale Kinderziekenhuis in Hanoi. Ze planned, organiseert, begeleidt, superviseert en rapporteert ieder project. De uitvoeringstijd is ca 2 maanden en omvat een groep van 50 tot 150 kinderen.

De bedoeling is met terugkerende projecten achterstand in behandeling in te lopen. On the fly worden lokale artsen bijgeschoold. Het medisch spectrum omvat orthopedie, brandletsels, urologie en schisis/open palate. Bepaalde oog operaties worden ook verricht.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:33.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, opgericht 2005, KvK 32108816, ANBI, opteert voor het nieuwe keurmerk Kleine Goede Doelen van het ISF","info@childsurgery-vietnam.org","","109732243","","","Stichting CHILD SURGERY - Việt Nam (CSVN)","","None","37","2008-11-19","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Deze ontmoeting heeft hem niet meer losgelaten en ondertussen groeide er een verlangen om deze ex-kindsoldaten en kindmoeders uit hun vaak schrijnende situaties te halen. Daarom heeft hij samen met twee andere jonge mensen die ook zich bezighouden met ontwikkelingsproblematiek, Seline Palm en Elsbeth van Wijk, de War Affected Children's Fund opgericht.  Sinds december 2007 helpen wij tienermoeders en voormalige kindsoldaten in Noord Oeganda om zelfstandig uit hun situatie van extreme armoede te komen. Wij doen dit door één jaar lang in hen te investeren; wij zorgen dat ze getraind worden in 'sparen en investeren' en voorzien hen van agrarische productiemiddelen, zoals land, ossen en ploegen, waarmee zij producten kunnen maken waarmee ze een inkomen kunnen vergaren.

Het project is in 2008 gestart, onder de naam Christian Vision Uganda, met de bouw van een Trainingscentrum. De projectleider is Jackson Kasozi. Hij werd ondersteund door de stichting in Engeland, Christian Hope International. 
De aanleiding van het project was de toename van het aantal weeskinderen, ten gevolge van Hiv/Aids, in de regio Kibaale en de slechte omstandigheden omtrent de watervoorziening. Er zijn steeds meer jongeren die geen mogelijkheid hebben om voortgezet onderwijs te volgen. Het Trainingscentrum gaat jongeren een kans bieden om praktische beroepsvaardigheden aan te leren om zodoende te kunnen voorzien in hun eigen levensonderhoud.  De trainingen zullen naar verwachting in september 2012 kunnen starten. 
Vanaf  2011 is de naam Matendo actief geworden. Deze naam is een paraplu voor alle ontwikkelingsactiviteiten die in de regio plaatsvinden. 
In 2011 is in Nederland de stichting Matendo opgericht. Deze stichting werkt projectmatig en richt zich met name op de watervoorziening in de regio Kibaale.

De begeleidingscommissie in Uganda bestaat uit 8 personen en is verantwoordelijk voor de beleidsontwikkeling en begeleiding. De projectleider Jackson Kasozi heeft de dagelijkse leiding. In Nederland zijn er binnen de Stichting Matendo twee personen actief.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:06.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.

The country has been ruled over by undemocratic forces for more than half of its life. It resulted in inappropriate policies, corruption, social injustice and poverty.

In 2008, a group of local activists in District Lodhran decided to establish a joint platform to work for sustainable development especially with context to governance, human rights, democracy and community development. In this perspective, Organization for Public Interest came into being in November 2008. OPI was registered as a not-for-profit non-governmental organization in September 2009 under the Societies Registration Act, 1860.

Our Vision:

OPI envisions a democratic, fair and progressive society that is free of poverty and injustice while people have equal rights and opportunities to realize their full potential for attaining their individual and collective goals.
Mission Statement:

The mission of OPI is to bring about positive changes in policies and institutions for sustainable socio-economic development by mobilizing and empowering women, youth and other marginalized groups of the society.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 in Pakistan video registration No. LD-21/2009-2010 and National Tax Number 3389635-6.","gulfam@opi.org.pk","MCB Bank Limited","0343552671001096","","MUCBPKKA","Organization for Public Interest","Kamboh Plaza","Pakistan","1023","2011-05-29","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

In het Swahili betekent Endeleo 'vooruitgang, ontwikkeling'. Onze doelstelling is een bijdrage te leveren aan het realiseren van de millenniumdoelen en daarmee armoede te bestrijden. Via kleinschalige projecten en ontwikkelingssamenwerking kunnen wij op kleine schaal structureel het welzijn en de levensstandaard verbeteren in derdewereldlanden. De hulpvraag voor een project dient voort te komen vanuit de organisatie in het ontwikkelingsland en er dient een duidelijk eindpunt te zijn. Het kleinschalige van de projecten en de afbakening in tijd maakt dat resultaten overzichtelijk en snel zichtbaar zijn. Stichting Endeleo stelt zich verder ten doel om de maatschappelijke betrokkenheid van mensen en organisaties te verhogen. Wij betrekken op creatieve manieren mensen bij het inzamelen van geld voor de projecten. Ook geven we voorlichting over onze activiteiten op lokale en nationale evenementen. 
De stichting Endeleo is opgericht in juli 2009 en geregistreerd bij de Kamer van Koophandel te Maastricht onder nummer 14118749. In de statuten zijn de rollen officieel vastgesteld. In de praktijk maken we echter zoveel mogelijk gebruik van de individuele kwaliteiten van de bestuursleden. De bestuursleden zijn op hun vakanties in aanraking gekomen met inspirerende mensen en de vaak erbarmelijke omstandigheden waaronder zij (moeten) leven. Met deze stichting willen wij concreet bijdragen aan het verbeteren van hun levensstandaard. 
 
Een van de bestuursleden heeft een safaribedrijf in Tanzania. Met gasten bezoekt zij, indien gewenst, dit weeshuis. Vanuit deze hoek ontvangen wij enthousiaste mensen die ook graag bij willen dragen aan dit project. Een persoon heeft gezamelijk met ons een aanvraag ingediend bij zijn bedrijf om dit project te ondersteunen twv 5000 euro. Andere sponsors die al een bijdrage hebben geleverd aan dit project zijn Guus van Rooy (ontwerpen logo), notaris (oprichtingskosten stichting), Anna Snoep (vertalen website in het Engels), milestre (hosting website) en NCDO (verdubbeling ingezamelde gelden). Rond de kerst vinden onze eerste grote activiteiten plaats, te weten een kerstkaartenactie (10.000 stuks) en plaatsing van posters in de stad Utrecht. Er is een persbericht geplaatst in de weekkrant. http://www.deweekkrant.nl/artikel/2009/november/06/duurzame_energie_voor_weeshuis_in_tanzania","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:53.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvK nummer - 14118749","henrike.konings@xs4all.nl","","390291757","","","Stichting Endeleo Foundation","","None","283","2009-10-02","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

SCORE is in 1991 opgericht door een voormalig Olympisch atlete als reactie op de kritieke toestand van jongeren in townships in Zuid-Afrika. Naast Zuid-Afrika is SCORE tegenwoordig ook werkzaam in Zambia, Namibië, Lesotho en Nederland. SCORE zet op een duurzame wijze sport en spel activiteiten op en gebruikt sport om jongeren vaardigheden te laten ontwikkelen op het gebied van sport, management en levensvaardigheden. SCORE zorgt ervoor dat jongeren de kans krijgen om zich te ontwikkelen én een bijdrage kunnen leveren aan hun community. SCORE focust hierbij op leiderschap en rolmodellen, vrouwen en sport en HIV/AIDS preventie. Niet voor niets is de slogan van SCORE; ‘Changing Lives Through Sport’!

De Nederlandse tak van SCORE -SCORE NL- is opgericht in 2003 en ondersteunt sindsdien SCORE in zuidelijk Afrika met fondsen, met vrijwilligers (werven, selectie, training en coaching) en met marketing communicatie. Daarnaast is SCORE NL onlangs in Nederlandse wijken gestart met de implementatie van een in Afrika ontwikkeld SCORE programma (Cup of Heroes). In Nederland zijn 2 fulltime mensen in dienst. Daarnaast wordt er veel gewerkt met vrijwilligers en stagiaires voor de organisatie van evenementen in Nederland.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:41.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Toen ik moeder werd ben ik gastouder geworden. Mijn man heeft HTS gedaan en is jarenlang als technisch commercieel medewerker werkzaam geweest bij verschillende middelgrote bedrijven in Nederland.
In 2003 zijn mijn man en ik met onze twee kinderen naar Cambodja gekomen met het idee om met kinderen te werken. Eenmaal hier aangekomen zagen we dat we misschien wel meer voor deze kinderen konden betekenen door ouders in staat te stellen zelf een inkomen te verdienen en zo zelf voor een stabielere thuisbasis te zorgen, dan door zelf rechtstreeks met de kinderen te werken. Soksabbaai is hieruit voortgekomen.
Soksabbaai is een trainings- en werkgelegenheidsproject met als doel om Cambodjanen met een arme achtergrond te trainen en aan het werk te helpen als designer en allround kleermaker. Cambodja kent veel textielfabrieken en die kenmerken zich door erg eenzijdig werk, waarbij geen ruimte is voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling. Bij Soksabbaai willen we de naaisters alles leren wat nodig is om zelfstandig aan de slag te kunnen.
Wij hebben dit project in 2004 opgestart en sommigen van de medewerkers, die in het begin getraind zijn door Soksabbaai werken nu bij ons, als trainer. De meeste mensen die nu bij Soksabbaai werken en getraind worden zijn in het begin van dit jaar begonnen en zitten midden in hun training. Wijzelf zijn ook nog bij dit project betrokken voor verdere training in onder andere accounting, administratie, design etc. Inmiddels zijn er al verschillende oud-medewerkers hun eigen weg gegaan en hebben een eigen winkeltje of atelier geopend, met succes.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","In het proces van registreren bij het ministerie van werkgelegenheid in Cambodja.","soksabbaai@hotmail.com","","4825070","","","Soksabbaai","","None","134","2009-02-06","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Ten tweede  het financieren van vervolgopleidingen voor leerlingen met een hoge slagingskans.

Het bestuur van de stichting bestaat uit 3 bestuursleden die zich met de dagelijkse taken omtrent de stichting bezighouden en 2 toegevoegde leden.
Het idee om een school te ondersteunen is ontstaan na een bezoek aan Noord India in 2008. Na bevoorrading van dit schooltje in 2009  hebben we een aantal andere schooltjes bezocht waar de leerlingen en leraren in dezelfde omstandigheden verkeerden. Dat wil zeggen: geen schoolboeken, schriften of pennen en al zeker geen sportmaterialen. In augustus 2009 is de stichting officieel opgericht en ondersteunen we nu 10 schooltjes met in totaal 230 leerlingen.

The Optical Foundation werkt samen met de Universiteit van Cape Coast in Ghana.
In februari 2007 is Carolien Kunnen, optometrist en orthoptist naar Ghana afgereisd om daar ons eerste project 'The Glasshoppper' op te zetten. De Universiteit van Cape Coast functioneert als basisstation. Vanuit Cape Coast trekt Carolien samen met optometrie studenten van de Universiteit erop uit om screening verrichten in dorpen en op scholen. De studenten krijgen zo praktijk ervaring; een voorname factor om in de toekomst voor eigen land dit werk te kunnen doen. 

Als de kinderen een bril nodig hebben kunnen zij deze voor een inkomensafhankelijk bedrag aanschaffen. Niet voor niets, want iets dat niets kost wordt als waardeloos gezien. De brillen worden op de Universiteit door een technische man gemaakt en vervolgens weer door ons afgeleverd. Belangrijk is dat afgestudeerde optometrie studenten dit werk uiteindelijk over nemen, dan is dit project geslaagd.

The Optical Foundation wil juist de vrouwen in Ghana steunen en hen opleiden tot zelfstandige ondernemers. Daarom hebben we in overleg met de vrouwelijke studenten een vrouwenteam gemaakt, zodat ook zij de leuke en minder leuke werkzaamheden kunnen verrichten. Zo willen we de vrouwen de kans geven om volgens dezelfde rechten als de man te leren en te werken.

Onze stichting in Nederland bestaat uit 3 enthousiaste bestuursleden. 
Arthur Alberts: Oprichter en bestuurslid T.O.F.
Optometrist en werkzaam in Maastricht

Huub Villevoye: Secretaris T.O.F.
Ex-bankdirecteur, Maastricht

Carolien Kunnen: Voorzitster T.O.F.
Optometrist en orthoptist werkzaam in Utrecht

De stichting in Ghana bestaat uit een dertigtal enthousiaste optometrie studenten van de University of Cape Coast.

Wij willen in samenwerking met onze projectpartners in ontwikkelingslanden het toekomstperspectief van straatkinderen vergroten. Hiertoe zetten we de kracht van theater in om straatkinderen hun trots en eigenwaarde terug te geven, de positie en het draagvlak van de partnerorganisaties te verbeteren en meer betrokkenheid en verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel te creëren binnen de gemeenschap waar het kind deel van uit maakt.
In Nederland versterken we tegelijkertijd op een creatieve manier actief het draagvlak voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De Nederlandse stichting versterkt tijdelijk het lokale team van de partner stichting. Onder het motto van 'train de trainer' word een project medewerker van de partnerorganisatie getraind in het toepassen van theater-pedagogische vaardigheden tijdens het maken van een theatervoorstelling met de gezamenlijke doelgroep, namelijk de rehabiliterende straatkinderen. Stichting Ubuntu is opgezet in 2006 door Marieke de Lange. Ubuntu Theatre Organisation wordt gerund door Renske Hofman en Marieke de Lange. Zij zijn beide theatermakers/docenten en zetten zich full time voor de stichting in.
In buitenland behelst dit het uitvoeren van de theaterprojecten met lokale partnerorganisaties en in Nederland bestaan de werkzaamheden voornamelijk uit fondsenwerving, acquisitie, communicatie en p.r, draagvlakversterking en het uitvoeren van educatieve projecten in het basisonderwijs.
Ubuntu heeft een driekoppig bestuur bestaande uit:
- Berith Danse, voorzitter, artistiek leidster van de Theatre Embassy
- Kees Bruinstroop, penningmeester, voorzitter van de Rabobank Foundation
- Bart Neervoort, secretaris, advocaat en mediator
De boekhouding wordt gedaan door de heer T. Dierikx

Het motto van World Servants is ‘bouwen aan jezelf door te bouwen voor een ander’. Een World Servants-project vormt deelnemers tot betrokken wereldburgers en goede ambassadeurs van ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De deelnemers zijn jongeren en volwassen tussen de 16 en 72 jaar en komen uit heel Nederland. Jaarlijks is er sprake van 65% nieuwe deelnemers. In 2009 organiseert World Servants 30 projecten in 13 ontwikkelingslanden en gaan er 1.000 deelnemers met een World Servants project mee.

Het kantoor van Stichting World Servants Nederland  (WSN) is gevestigd in Wolvega. WSN is in 1988 ontstaan vanuit een particulier initiatief. World Servants wil mensen enthousiast maken en toerusten om zich dienstbaar in te zetten in deze wereld. Directeur van WSN is Els Nijman. Daarnaast zitten op het kantoor in Wolvega nog 14 medewerkers (10 FTE) en zet een groot aantal vrijwilligers zich in voor het werk van World Servants

Buiten Europa bestaan er eveneens World Servants organisaties, namelijk in de Verenigde Staten, de Dominicaanse Republiek (genaamd Serviores Mundiales Inc) en Canada. Alle organisaties zijn financieel, bestuurlijk en organisatorisch onafhankelijk van elkaar.

Serviores Mundiales Inc. is de partner van World Servants in de Dominicaanse Republiek waarmee wordt samengewerkt. Deze relatie is tot stand gekomen via het internationale netwerk van World Servants. Sinds 1987 ondersteunt World Servants Nederland projecten op de Dominicaanse Republiek. De organisatie daar is sindsdien gegroeid wat in enkele jaren werk resulteerde in 1997 tot een lokaal geregistreerde NGO - Asociacion Servidores Mundiales. Servidores Mundiales is een christelijke intermediaire en netwerkorganisatie. Directeur is Daniel Rodriguez. 

Serviores Mundiales Inc. functioneert als facilitator tussen World Servants en de aanvrager. De rol van de partnerorganisatie is het ondersteunen van plaatselijke gemeenschappen bij de verbetering van de levensomstandigheden door de bouw van scholen, klinieken, waterleidingen, latrines en woningen. Dit doen zijn o.a. door het faciliteren van teams uit Nederland en de USA die assisteren bij de realisatie van de bovengenoemde projecten. 

Samen met Servidores Munidales continueert World Servants de activiteiten die bijdragen aan het verbeteren van de  levensomstandigheden in het gebied rondom Los Anones. Hier zullen in meerdere gemeenschappen de water- en sanitaire voorzieningen verbeterd worden. TACISAR is de partner die technische ondersteuning levert bij de uitvoering van de projecten. Servidores Munidales brengt een basisgezondheidsprogramma in dat voorziet in een mobiele kliniek die frequent de betreffende gemeenschappen bezoekt. Ook verzorgen zij een leiderschapstraining gericht op het dienstbaar zijn aan je gemeenschap. In 2007 is het woningbouwproject in de barrio El Gajito in Constanza gestart. Hierbij maken we gebruik van de ervaring opgedaan in het project in Ocara – Brazilië.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:59.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Wahid Hasyim 51/74","Medan","","2015 OO","Indonesia","","","","","","006285276869101","","","http://www.acehturtleconservation.org","","","","","","","Yayasan Pulau Banyak is een lokale NGO in Indonesië die haar activiteiten startte in 1994 met als doel het combineren van bescherming van de zeeschildpad en het bieden van een alternatieve inkomstenbron voor de lokale bevolking. De activiteiten concentreren zich op het eiland Pulau Banyak, een archipel voor de kust in het zuidoosten van Aceh, dat in het noorden van het Indonesische Sumatra ligt.

Momenteel heeft de stichting 13 mensen in dienst die afkomstig zijn van de eilandengroep of andere delen van Aceh. Buiten dit team zijn er nog 2 personen, niet afkomstig uit Indonesie, die zich actief en full time inzetten voor de stichting. Mahmud Bangkaru, die voor het eerst het gebieden het nest strand van de zeeschildpadden bezocht in 1994 en hierdoor aanleiding zag om de eilanden meer te beschermen, heeft de stichting indertijd opgezet. Maggie Muurmans hielp samen met Mahmud, om in 2006, na een korte stop door de burgeroorlog, de stichting weer te herinstallereen en te helpen met het wetenschappelijke deel van het zeeschildpaddenprogramma op te zetten en te fundraisen.


De activiteiten waar de stichting zich op dit moment mee bezighoudt:

- Ontwikkeling van afval verwerkings strategie binnen de archipel

- Het proberen te verhogen van de status van het beschermde gebied

- Het ontwikkeling van een “entree geld systeem” waarbij toer operators die het gebied bezoeken niet alleen maar de natuurlijke hulpbronnen (golven, bos, strand) gebruiken maar ook een bijdrage achterlaten voor de lokale bevolking en natuurbeschermings initiatieven.

- Het in kaart brengen van het gebied en met behulp hiervan zones bepalen voor verschillende activiteiten.

- Gebouwen bouwen en sportvelden aanleggen in ruil voor de bescherming van mangroven, bos en koraalrif.

- Promoten van het project en het vinden en plaatsen van internationale vrijwilligers die engelse les geven of meehelpen op het zeeschildpaddenproject.


Activiteiten die de stichting met succes heeft afgerond:

- Ontwikkeling van kleinschalig eco-toerisme. Contacten zijn al gelegd met een Nederlandse toer operator die regelmatig groepen stuurt naar Pulau Banyak.

- Trainen van lokale gidsen om toeristen mee te nemen op Kayak of jungle trekking tours. Deze gidsen kunnen ook gebruik maken van de materialen die de stichting voor dit intiatief heeft aangeschaft zoals kayaks, peddels, rugzakken en campingmaterialen

- Het opzetten van een onderzoeks station en bezoekercentrum om het zeeschildpadden neststrand en een team van 6 full time strandpatrouilleerders die het informatie verzamelen over de zeeschildpadden die aan land komen om eieren te leggen en door hun patrouille direct de eieren van stroperij beschermen

- Het ontwikkelen van natuur educatie programma’s en lesprogramma’s voor scholen in samenwerking met de educatie bond en lokale scholen


De organisatie draait deels door sponsors, bijdragen van vrijwilligers en leden maar ook door de regelmatige stroom toeristen die door onze promotie gestaag maar met mate toeneemt.

De stichting heeft een 
samenwerkingsverband met de lokale overheid in Singkil, de universiteit van Banda Aceh, de forestry department van Aceh en de lokale bevolking. 
Yayasan Pulau Banyak zal samenwerking verlenen aan de vissers door 
middel van geld en kennis ontwikkeling. Er zullen groepen van vissers worden aangesteld die de vishuizen zullen realiseren en een apart team vanuit de organisatie de de evaluatie voor haar rekening zal nemen. Op 
lange termijn zullen de vissers zelf verantwoordelijk worden voor het beheer en onderhoud van de vishuizen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting in Indonesië.

It was established by a group of prominent Acehnese leaders and foreign activists and specialists in 1997. As Aceh carries a long history, so does the board of founders. 
With current founders in place, local trust and support is secured in the region; the former governor of Aceh, former regent of Aceh Jaya, former members of Indonesian parliament and regional parliaments and several professors of the University Syiah Kuala in Banda Aceh, are all members of Yayasan Pulau Banyak. The activities are managed in the field by trained and experienced local islanders and Acehnese, supervised and managed by Maggie Muurmans, a Dutch sea turtle expert with extensive experience in Latin America and Indonesia, and Mahmud Bangkaru, a Swedish eco-tourism expert with a long history in Aceh and well trusted by the local communities in Pulau Banyak. The field staff consists of permanently employed staff, including university graduates, and both domestic and international volunteers. Our staff policy is to employ locals where possible and increase the number of women employed, both as managers and as field staff. 
 Yayasan Pulau Banyak has established itself over many years as an organisation accepted and trusted by the local community and supported by a wide spectrum of respected and trusted political leaders in Aceh. Yayasan Pulau Banyak is also entrusted by the Indonesian government’s Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam (BKSDA-NAD) to manage the conservation efforts in Pulau Banyak. As a local NGO the community is proud to be part of all its efforts and activities and sees the organisation as “theirs”. 
Being a local organisation run by partly local people, traditions and cultures are being respected. All the above will positively affect the ability of the organisation to achieve proposed mission and objectives.
Some recent completed projects:
- Waste management assessment in the archipelago
- English teaching on all local schools and for local community members
- First aid course for staff and members of workgroups living on islands without access to doctors/nurses
- Training course for all local teachers on how to deliver environmental education programmes
- Protection of the nesting beach of 3 species of (critically endangered) sea turtles
- Set up of eco-tourism programme by providing equipment and training
The organization has 16 staff, all from the islands or Aceh. The only two foreigners active in the organization is Mahmud Bangkaru (Sweden) and Maggie Muurmans (Dutch) who assist in the running of the programmes. International volunteers visit the project on and off with an average of 2 volunteers per month. Previous volunteers have assisted in teaching English and patrolling the beach to collect data on the nesting sea turtles. The strength of Yayasan Pulau Banyak is that we are very localised. In this way we have a strong support network and the local community sees the organisation as one of their own. Expanding to other areas in Indonesia would spread us thin.  We have completed the waste management assessment and methods of transporting, recycling or storing the waste have been carried forward. The certified first aid training sessions have been conducted in several villages for mainly staff and prominent community members. This has helped to them to make risk assessments and take precautionary measures. The training will be refreshed every year.
Teachers on the environmental training programme have received a certificate from the education board (government body) and our organisation. The training ran for 2 weeks in the field and 1 week theory.
Population numbers for turtles are not certain yet. As turtles need to be monitored and tagged for a minimum of 3 years to be able to estimate the population size, we have not been able to do so yet as the tagging programme has only been running for 2.5 years. (nesting intervals for greens and leatherbacks are 2-3 years). We do know that we are dealing with a medium size rookery and a very important nesting beach for Sumatra for the green and leatherback turtle.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Foundation

DUM is a slum-based rehabilitation centre struggling for the uplift and development of the mentally retarded children mainly in Baldia Town.
	
DUM is a day care-centre for mentally handicapped children in Baldia Town. It was started in January 1985 in a rented house with the help of a trained Japanese teacher who knew Urdu, and two girls from the area who were learning to work with differently-abled children. One of these pioneer learning teachers is still working in the centre, but an experienced Pakistani teacher, who is still incharge, replaced the Japanese teacher. The centre grew slowly and there are several children who have got the basic education, skills and training in the past 25 years. Although many of them are not able to lead their life independently, yet many of them have become much independent and helping hands for their families. 

Initially DUM was located in a rented place. However, after a long struggle and support by UNITING CHURCHES IN THE NETHERLANDS (UCN) our dream  became true and we had shifted in the new building in 2000, which is Dar-ul-Mussarat’ s own property, bigger than the old rented place. We could not get a big piece of land as expected, for it was very difficult to find such a big piece of land in the project area and secondly the prices of the land became so high that we could only purchase a piece of land measuring 600 sq. yards with the available amount at that time. 

With the passage of time and with the generous support of our donors we were able to construct a single-storey building for DUM. Consequently, children were feeling happy even more secure and comfortable. But the children used to desperately feel that there was no space to play for them. It is true that there was a small lawn but it was not enough to play for the children. 

In the due course of time, our generous friends from UCN and Bab-ul-Mussarrat (BUM) France happened to visit DUM Karachi. They appreciated the construction of the building but felt a great need of an empty space where children could run and play. They generously offered that if the piece of land attached with the building of DUM is acquired the funds could be arranged. Consequently, we worked very hard for this purpose and succeeded to purchase piece of land measuring 240 square yards attached with DUM building. Now, fortunately, DUM has a small playground where children can play and run here and there. However, in the scope of the present proposal the extension of play ground is desired to cope up the increasing number of students. The bigger playground can also be rented out as marriage hall and arranging community’s events, thereby generating income for DUM.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","DuM-Karachi is working for the rehabilitation and development of the children with special needs since 1985. in this poor slum of Baldia town ship of Karachi.

Our mission statement says “A non-partisan, non-profit making and non-governmental organization formed purely of the desire to identify and support rural communities’ self help initiatives, to encourage sustainable development, and to provide assistance and support without any form of discrimination, and to prevent and alleviate poverty and suffering among the rural people of Zambia, especially women, youths and children”

PSRD was registered in July 2000 after realization that there were no local NGOs actively involved in providing clean water and other developmental support in Zambia.  This left only international NGOs do the work at very high operational costs.

Currently PSRD has four full time workers and over 5 part-time workers and around twenty volunteers that come in to help only when need arise.

The NGO has implemented water and sanitation projects with;
‘Water Aid’ (2006-2008) - Water and sanitation projects in two districts of Zambia where 12 boreholes, 15 hand-dug wells, 21 school latrines and over 1,000 household latrines were constructed.

‘UNICEF’- (2008-2009) - Implemented a water and sanitation project for resettled flood victims where 100 household latrines were constructed, 5 school latrines were constructed and effective hygiene education was conducted to prevent spread of diarrheal diseases.

‘Source Connection Foundation’ of Holland (2007-2009) – Implemented a household water treatment project using bio-sand filters for 400 households.  These households also received treadle pumps for gardening activities in order to promote income generation and food security in the area.  Hygiene education and latrine construction was part of this project.

In all these projects PSRD worked with communities on the ground to identify their needs and together with them agreed on practical solutions that were later on implemented.  PSRD was involved in formulating project proposals and managing all project funds after they have been raised.  All progress and final reports on these projects were prepared by PSRD.  In addition, PSRD conducted all the needed community capacity building activities in areas such as; latrine construction, hand pump maintenance, making, installation and operation of bio-sand filters.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered NGO in Zambia.

Zij geeft praktische en structurele hulp aan mensen om uit de armoede te komen en hun levensstandaard te verhogen. 

Bij armoedebestrijding richt Sparrow zich op drie gebieden:

- empowerment: toegang tot en controle over lokale middelen, publieke diensten, inspraak in lokaal beleid, etcetera;

- security: het reduceren van de kwetsbaarheid in de leefomgeving van de armen en het verbeteren van de mogelijkheid om met 'shocks' om te gaan;

- opportunity: toegang tot inkomsten genererende activiteiten, onderwijs, gezondheid en andere factoren die van directe invloed zijn op het welzijn van de mens.

Sparrow is februari 2009 officieel opgericht. Zij bestaat uit een Raad van Toezicht in Nederland en een kantoor in de Filippijnen. De Raad van Toezicht heeft een controlerende functie op de directie. Zij kijken of het beleid aansluit bij de doelstellingen van Sparrow, of er een financieel verantwoordelijk beleid wordt uitgevoerd en zij keuren strategische beslissingen.

Op dit moment werken er vijf personen fulltime op het kantoor in de Filippijnen. Deze personen werken op vrijwillige basis. Dit betekent dat zij geen salaris uitgekeerd krijgen en voor hun levensonderhoud volledig afhankelijk zijn van giften.

Bestuursleden: Johan Derks, IJsselmuiden: voorzitter en voorlopig penningmeester, Renato Corsetti, Italië: secretaris, Madzy van der Kooy, Zwolle: bestuurslid, Terezija Kapista, Belgrado, bestuurslid.  Johan Derks en zijn vrouw Svetlana Milanovic, die een esperanto-huwelijk hebben, hebben de organisatie voor het project gestart. 
De reden is het prettige contact dat we in januari hebben gekregen met onze Afrikaanse geestverwanten, het overweldigende entousiasme voor Esperanto en de enorm lage levensstandaard die we daar hebben aangetroffen. De reden is, dat Esperanto een neutrale NIET KOLONIAAL BESMETTE taal is. Burundi hoort tot de tien armste landen in de wereld, dus is er geen geld voor leerboeken en het organiseren van bijeenkomsten.
Mijn vrouw heeft in twee weken aan 108 jonge leerlingen enkele beginselen van het Esperanto geleerd en ik heb aan 35 jongelui twee weken lang cursussen van middelbaar en hoger niveau gegeven.

We hebben In Burundi intensief overlegd met Hasan Ntahonsigaye, Pamphile Bahatu, Jérémie Nsaviyumba en Leopold Mugabo over welk project aan de ANEB (partnerorganisatie) een financiële basis zou kunnen geven. De leden zijn namelijk te arm om contributie te kunnen betalen.

Voorlopig is de beurt aan ons om door middel van verkoop van T-shirts, lezingen over Burundi, oproepen met verwijzing naar onze webstek en subsidieaanvragen geld in te zamelen. De T-shirts zijn inmiddels uitverkocht. Van 19 tot 23 oktober bezoeken we drie Duitse en een Poolse stad en geven daar een lezing. De bouwgroep, bestaande uit bovengenoemde personen, geeft bekendheid aan ons/hun project door publiciteit in internetdiscussie en nieuwsgroepen, bijv rundaj-esperantistoj@googlegroups.com. Daarvan bestaan er in Esperanto honderden.
 
Het doel van de stichting: het financieel ondersteunen van renderende projecten in arme landen die ten doel hebben de daar aanwezige Esperanto-beweging een noodzakelijke financiële basis te geven.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:28.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, geregistreerd onder nr. 08198652, KvK Zwolle","derks.esp@tiscali.nl","","131296116","","","St. Esperanto en evoluo","","None","300","2009-10-18","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De Stichting New Start heeft als doel het ondersteunen van de boeren en landbouwers(met zaden, landbouwgereedschappen, meststoffen) in de voormalige oorlogsgebieden in Midden Afrika. Mede tegen deze achtergrond streven we naar wederopbouw door ze de mogelijkheid te bieden om opnieuw te kunnen starten in de landbouw en veeteelt.
Om aan de wettelijke eisen van de regering in Congo te voldoen was het  noodzakelijk om een lokale zusterorganisatie in Congo te hebben. 
Daarom werd in 2006  een zusterorganisatie gesticht. We werken samen met deze lokale zusterorganisatie genaamd New Start-Likede.
Deze organisatie bestaat uit mevrouw Mafundisho Fatuma (Coördinator), de heer Arnaud Ndonge (assistent-Coördinator), de heer Didier Mulumba (expert-account), de heer Frederique Mputu (landbouwkundige-analist) en de heer Pierre Monse (administratief medewerker). Ze zijn allemaal vrijwilligers en steunen  op dit moment vijf  kleine organisaties met zaden, landbouwgereedschappen, onderhouden van de grond, meststoffen en expertise. New Start-Likede begeleidt en bezoekt de projecten regelmatig en houdt Stichting New Start zorgvuldig op de hoogte van de gang van zaken en alle ontwikkelingen. De kleine organisaties of Coöperaties maken plannen en sturen die naar onze zusterorganisatie New Start-Likede. Nadat NS-L de plannen heeft nagekeken en gecorrigeerd, gaan de plannen vervolgens naar de Stichting New Start in Nederland om fondsen voor de zaden, landbouwgereedschappen en meststoffen te zoeken.    In dit project werken we samen met één van de vijf kleine organisaties: Coöperatie AMK in  Congo Democratische Republiek.

 In Nederland heeft de stichting voorlichting gegeven aan Oostafrikanen over juridische, medische en culturele aspecten, erop gericht om hun betrokkenheid bij hun nieuwe land te bevorderen. Verder organiseert de stichting culturele evenementen om de aanwezigheid van Afrikaanse cultuur in onze multiculturele samenleving zichtbaar te maken en ontmoetingspunten te bieden aan Oost Afrikanen, jong en oud, met hun culturele achtergronden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:58.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","",":24336459","info@oostafrica.com","ABNAMRO","444769870","NL29ABNA0444769870","ABNANL2A","Stichting Oost Africa","Raadhuisplein 55","Netherlands","1806","2013-01-23","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

SIFE staat voor Students In Free Enterprise en is een internationaal concept wat zijn origine kent in de Verenigde Staten van Amerika. De insteek van SIFE is dat studenten tijdens hun studietijd de theoretische vaardigheden die ze verwerven in de praktijk gaan uitvoeren. De projecten van teams moeten aan minimaal één van de SIFE criteria voldoen, zoals ""Market economics"", ""Entrepreneurship"", ""Financial Literacy"", ""Business Ethics"" en ""(Environmental) Sustainability"".

Kort na de oprichting is, vanwege de persoonlijke achtergronden van enkele leden, besloten om ons voornamelijk te richten op Bolivia, het armste land in Zuid Amerika. Het eerste jaar van het bestaan van SIFE Leiden had dan ook twee doelstellingen: allereerst, het opzetten van een goed lopende organisatie; ten tweede, voet aan de grond krijgen in Bolivia door een lokaal netwerk op te zetten. Deze doelstellingen zijn meer dan gehaald want aan het eind van 2007 had SIFE Leiden meerdere projecten lopen in Bolivia, een professionele organisatie met een uitgebreid ondersteunend netwerk en was de groep van vijf studenten inmiddels gegroeid tot boven de twintig. Als kroon op het werk kreeg SIFE Leiden eind 2007 te horen dat zij voortaan als stichting SIFE Leiden door het leven mocht gaan met een ANBI-status (Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling) en daarnaast een gerenommeerd Comité van Aanbeveling en een zeer professionele Raad van Toezicht. Dit opende voor ons de deur om onze projecten ook financiële steun te bieden en onze organisatie nog professioneler te maken.

De projecten die opgezet worden worden opgezet met hulp van sponsoren, zoals vermeld bij de partnerorganisaties. Naast financiële steun helpen partnerorganisaties ook met het maken van contacten en het verstrekken van kennis. Daarnaast werken we met projectpartners ter plekke van het project. De lokale projectpartner komt met een initiatief voor een project in eerste instantie en komt via contacten of wedstrijden in contact met SIFE Leiden. Op deze manier wordt de samenwerking aangegaan en ontstaan er interessante relaties.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.

We zagen hoe moeilijk het was voor veel mensen om het hoofd boven water te houden. We zagen alleenstaanden met vier, soms zes kinderen die geen inkomen hadden en nergens terecht kunnen.
Vanuit onze verantwoordelijkheid als wereldburger iets te doen tegen armoede en een duurzame wereld te creëren hebben we dit project gestart. 
Bovendien zagen we dat er mogelijkheden waren om levensomstandigheden ter plaatse te verbeteren, maar de middelen en vaardigheden ontbraken. Vandaar dit initiatief!
Samen met de mensen om wie het gaat, bepalen we de strategie.
Tijdens ons tweede bezoek kwamen we in gesprek een mevrouw van de met plaatselijke vrouwenorganisatie OMCV op Mosteiros. Ze hadden albepaalde plannen, maar het ontbrak hun aan middelen. Samen met die vrouwen zijn we naar de gemeente gestapt en afsprakengemaakt. De vrouwen zullen  de stichting rapporteren over de werkzaamheden die plaats zullen gaan vinden. De activiteiten zullen een verbetering en een impuls geven aan de lokale economie en het sociale leven. Wanneer het project eenmaal is gestart, is ook de begeleiding, voortgang en evaluatie een primaire verantwoordelijkheid van de stichting. Ook zijn we nu begonnen met de voorbereiding van het verstrekken van microkredieten.
Voor de financiering van deze projecten is de Stichting- Fogo totaal afhankelijk van donaties en subsidies. 
Al het werk voor de stichting hier gebeurt door vrijwilligers. Uw steun komt dus direct bij de mensen waar voor het bedoeld is.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:31.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","De Stiching is opgericht op 22 december 2006 bij acte verleden voor  notaris Mr.J.C.M.

Onderwijs is voor SDO het kernpunt om de levenskwaliteit van de Dogon te verbeteren. Uitwisseling en overdracht van kennis zijn één van de belangrijkste bouwstenen voor duurzame ontwikkeling. De aanpak van SDO is kleinschalig. Er wordt gewerkt met een lokale aannemer en er wordt gebouwd met respect voor de lokale bouwtraditie en met materialen die in het gebied voorhanden zijn.

Het startpunt ligt bij goede waterputten en dammen, want pas als voorzien is in de primaire levensbehoeften, krijgt onderwijs een kans. Na het water volgen de gebouwen. Op verzoek van de dorpsbewoners worden scholen en andere voorzieningen gerealiseerd. Toch is het geen kwestie van alleen maar bouwen: SDO werkt ook aan het realiseren van andere belangrijke voorwaarden voor onderwijs, zoals de aanwezigheid van leraren en lesmateriaal, afspraken met de lokale overheden en het stimuleren van eigen initiatief en verantwoordelijkheid.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:43.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting","stichtingdogononderwijs@gmail.com","ING Bank","P4538261","","INGBNL2A","Stichting Dogon Onderwijs","Rokin 90, 1012 KX","Netherlands","1868","2013-03-07","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Door 5 jaar ervaring met de methodiek van The hunger Project was ons duidelijk dat de vrouwen de hefboom zijn bij een echte ontwikkeling. THP kan door de beperkte middelen niet uitbreiden naar een 'nieuw' land (ze zijn actief in 8 landen in Afrika), dus besloten we om zelf een project op te zetten met de Dogonbevolking waar we zoveel liefde en respect voor voelen.

Guia doet dit door het ondersteunen van kleinschalige educatieve, recreatieve en werkgelegenheidsprojecten die de jongeren begeleiden van kind zijn tot volwassenheid.
Onze ervaringen als vrijwilligers in ontwikkelingswerk hebben geleid tot het oprichten van Stichting Guia.  In maart 2004 besloten Lucy en ik een non profit toeristen project op te gaan zetten in Nicaragua, naar het voorbeeld van Quetzaltrekkers in Guatemala. Dit project ""Quetzaltrekkers Nicaragua"" zamelt geld in door toeristen avontuurlijke tochten aan te bieden naar de vulkanen in de buurt van de stad Leon in Nicaragua. Het geld dat de toeristen voor de tochten betalen gaat direct naar een lokale organisatie “Las Tias”. Las Tias helpt kinderen die op straat leven en werken en voorziet hen van een educatie.  Meer informatie over dit project kun je vinden op www.quetzaltrekkers.com. Toen Quetzaltrekkers zijn naam had gevestigd en succesvol was gingen Lucy en ik meer direct met de kinderen werken. Ik wilde vooral de jongeren van het project Las Tias helpen. In samenwerking met Las Tias heb ik daarvoor een meubelmakerijtje en naaiatelier opgezet waar jongeren een vak kunnen leren en de kennis in praktijk kunnen brengen. Door het werken en omgaan met de jongeren merkte ik echter dat niet alle jongeren timmerman of kleermaker willen worden. De hulp die we hen boden ging dus deels verloren. De oplossing hiervoor vonden we in het concept van een non profit uitzend bureau voor kansarme jongeren. Lucy en ik begonnen aan het uitwerken van de plannen om dit project op te zetten. We besloten in Nederland “Stichting Guia” te registreren en daarmee officieel te werk te gaan en geld in te kunnen zamelen. In 2007 kregen we een donatie toegezegd om het non profit project in Bolivia op te gaan zetten. Begin 2008 vertrokken Lucy en ik naar Bolivia en enkele maanden later was het uitzendbureau “Bolsa de Empleo Guia” een feit. Het project draait inmiddels bijna drie jaar en is succesvol in het voorzien van gepast werk voor vele minder bedeelde jongeren in de stad Sucre, Bolivia.
Overige projecten die Lucy en ik tijdens ons verblijf in Nicaragua en Bolivia hebben ondersteund zijn het ontwerp en de begeleiding van de bouw van een school voor gehandicapte kinderen in Matagalpa (Nicaragua), de renovatie van een voetbalveldje in Leon(Nicaragua) en het ondersteunen van dagelijkse activiteiten bij Las Tias en Familias Especiales in Leon/Matagalpa (Nicaragua),  weeshuis Tata Juan de Dios en NGO Nanta in Sucre(Bolivia).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:50:15.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Geregistreerd bij de KvK (nummer 17192931)","info@guiafoundation.org","Rabobank","122845226","NL32RABO0122845226","RABONL2U","Stichting Guia","Sint Agathaplein 8","Netherlands","656","2010-08-04","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Mission: Women’ s empowerment with self- esteem, upspring of inherent quality, skill up- gradation and to enhance women led family with happiness and healthy social order.
Objectives: The broad objectives of STRISHAKTI are as follows-
1.	Social and Economical empowerment of women and making them self reliant through SHGs (Self Help Groups) and IGA (Income Generation Activity), organizing them against domestic violence/ gender discrimination/exploitation and enhancing their participation in decision-making in family/ society 
2.	Developing women leadership and organization in the community and their active participation in the local governance without any party affiliation
3.	Addressing environmental issues and bio-diversity conservation through peoples participation and active involvement of women Self Help Groups (SHGs)
4.	Development of health, education, sanitation, livelihood and vocational skills of youths with special focus on dalit, tribal, women, disabled and other marginalized sections of the society.
5.	Establishment of a healthy and happy family structure with equal status and leadership of women

Operational Area
Stri Shakti started its functioning from 8 villages of Sadar Block of Hazaribag District and presently it is operational in 4 Blocks of Hazaribag District namely Sadar, Katkamsandi , Churchu and Barkagaon Blocks of Hazaribag District in Jharkhand state in North India. There are presently 14 staff working with Stri Shakti.

Activities carried out:
1.	Micro Credit Program
Women Self Help Group:
Self-help group is an initiative to empower women by raising their economic status by promoting the habit of saving and proper investment.
With this vision Strishakti have formed 105 SHG in Sadar block of Hazaribag district. All the SHG do regular savings provide loan to its member and they have been linked with Micro credit program for different income generation activities. Under the Micro Credit Program, the SHG members are given loan at a lower interest rate so that they can start self-employment as per their convenience such as starting a small grocery shop, tailoring, piggery, poultry, craft making and so on.

2.	Health program
Identifying the importance of Health in the process of social development and improving the quality of life of rural areas, Strishakti has launched different health programs in the basic health care delivery system like:  
	Mobile Health Clinic:  Regular health camps are organized employing a MBBS doctor in different villages of Churchu block supported by Deptt. Of Welfare, Govt. of Jharkhand
	Sulabh Swabalambi Shahkari Swashtya Kendra (SSSSK-Easy accessible, self -Sustainable Cooperative health centre) It is a 3 bedded rural hospital at Demotand village of Hazaribag Sadar block, taking care of local health services and referral services for all kinds of diseases at low cost and providing institutional delivery services. In two years more than 15000 people has been benefited.

3.	Girls education
There are only three or four high schools in  a block (having about 150 Villages), and they are also located in or near to Block H.Q./ pucca Road side. This makes about 70% adolescent girls to drop their education after class 5th, because their parents do not allow an adolescent girl to walk or ride bi-cycle 5 to 6 Kms to reach a high school and also poor parents take an excuse that they have to marry their daughter and they have financial problem to meet the cost of education. Recognizing this problem, STRISHAKTI took an initiative to sponsor girl child for education through the help of Action Village India-UK. Till date it has enrolled 42 girls in different schools of Sadar Hazaribag Block, who are getting full sponsorship and their performance as compared to boys, are very superior.

4.	Adolescent RH Education Program
Eight adolescent Girls’ group and 4 Boys’ group (each group consisting 12 to 18 adolescents) has been well functioning since Jan ’06 and regular quarterly/monthly meetings are held with them on reproductive health issues. School intervention program has been also under process successfully in four schools of the area in Bavanawe, Demotand, Bhelwara and Bavnee villages. This has brought a good awareness and behavioral changes on sexuality, HIV/AIDs and reproductive health amongst the young teen-aged children. School intervention programs are conducted by health workers to create awareness among the students. 

5.	Rural Young Professional Program:
Rural young professional Program aims in capacitating 100 youths (one girl and one boy) from each village (50 villages of Barkagoan Block) and capacitate them in various trades. Those boys and girls are selected who are atleast 10th pass and have willingness to learn and further implement it in their village for ensuring development of their village. In this regard 50 youths (25 girls and 25 boys) from 25 villages have been trained in several trades so that employment opportunities are created for the in near future. This program is supported by CAPART, a government initiative. This project is run on different locations at the same time by hiring resource person, resource location for all the locations. It is possible to run the project in phases also one at a time.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:53:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","•	Registered under the Society Registration Act of XXI, 1860 with registration number 393 dated 22nd March 2006 at Ranchi-Jharkhand (after separation of Jharkhand state from Bihar it has to get also registered in Ranchi with Govt. of Jharkhand while earli","strishaktihzb@rediffmail.com","UNITED BANK OF INDIA","0877010270482","","UTBIINBBGDH","STRI SHAKTI","United bank of India, St. Columbus College Branch,  Post: College Mod, Hazaribag 825301 Jharkhand, INDIA","India","401","2010-03-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Met hulpprojecten die vaak een commerciële kant hebben, is structurele werking verzekerd; de projecten groeien door hun eigen succes. SYPO is in 2003 opgericht door Duko Hopman. Hij reisde na zijn eindexamen door Afrika en kwam in Oeganda bij de organisatie Pat the Child van Fred Kaggwa. Duko zag een leegstaand weeshuis, omdat Pat the Child geen vaste inkomsten had om voor de weeskinderen te zorgen. Samen met Fred is Duko toen op zoek gegaan naar een oplossing en zo in het idee voor het yoghurtproject ontstaan. Sinds eind 2008 zijn er naast het yoghurtproject ook nieuwe projecten ontstaan. 

De drie belangrijkste projecten van SYPO zijn op dit moment: - Het verstrekken van microcredieten aan kleine groepen vrouwen - Het opvangen van weeskinderen in pleeggezinnen en het verzorgen van een vast inkomen om het weeskind te onderhouden - Het bouwen van gezondheidsklinieken en het vergroten van basisgezondheidskennis in kleine dorpen. SYPO probeert voortdurend te zoeken naar manieren om beter hulp te bieden, door te leren van eerdere ervaringen. We besteden daarom veel aandacht aan het evalueren van onze projecten, zodat we resultaatgestuurd kunnen werken. 

Sypo bestaat in Nederland uit een bestuur en 3 werkgroepen, een voor ieder projecten. Ook heeft SYPO sinds kort een sponsorgroep die zich vooral richt op de financiële zaken om de stichting draaiende te houden. De werkgroepen in Nederland houden zich vooral bezig met begeleiding, evaluatie en financiering van de projecten in Oeganda. Binnen SYPO werkt iedereen op vrijwillige basis. In totaal bestaat de Nederlandse organisatie uit 14 personen. Dit jaar woont Duko Hopman met zijn partner in Oeganda om nog beter inzicht te krijgen in de situatie in Oeganda en de samenwerking met Fred Kaggwa en Charles Musisi van Pat the Child verder te verbeteren.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:54:05.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting, KvK: 's-Hertogenbosch 37109592","leonie.vandenheuvel@sypo.nl","Rabobank","111694248","","","SYPO","Mercurion 22/A, 6903 PZ","Netherlands","393","2010-02-25","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

The idea of establishing this club came as result of a meeting held between some students of the university and staff of Global Unification International who where in the Gambia as part of the Pre-African Union summit session for youth leaders. After a few months of work and a good response from the university students, the association was transformed into a national charitable association and became a legally registered entity on the 15th November 2006. 

As young students and the university being the centre of learning and innovation, we felt, that establishing this club will enable us to contribute:

1.the culture of research and innovation among students of the university
2.Involve the university students in community services and programs
3. Support Global Unification International in designing, promoting and influencing global policies on good governance, poverty reduction and human right, which we believe are inherent duties which all nations should try to achieve for its citizens.

From this date onwards, we have continued to influence various forums on gender reforms of the UN system and the MDGs, carried regular annual work programs  on the advancement of women, youth and children, environmental sustainability, good governance,  human rights.

 Ebrima Dem is the National Coordinator of Global Unification International in the Gambia. As such, he is responsible for coordinating and supervising the association’s activities in the country. Being a youth leader, Mr. Dem has represented  the voice of young people in major international fora such as the, UNEP Conference on the environment, held Daejeon, Korea,COP 16, Cancun, Mexico, 2010, COP-15 Climate Change summit held in Copenhagen, Denmark, December 2009 and the NMC world youth meeting held in Bari, Italy from the 19 to 21st January 2010.

How many staff members are working for Global Unification –The Gambia?
Global Unification has 10 staff members called the national committee, which is headed by the National Representative, 5 advisory members (board members) and 30 non permanent field workers. Note: all our staff are volunteers (not paid). 

Inspired by the principle of Earth Charter, Global Unification-The Gambia, joined Earth Charter International in May 2009, incorporating its activities into Earth Charters mission and thus, becoming a recognised Earth Charter Youth Group. (http://ecyg.wikispaces.com/Global+Unification).  Our volunteers also took part in Eglo online training 2009. Prior to this, we had meeting Jaana Leitinen (Earth Charter International youth Coordinator) at the Tunza youth conference, Daejeon, Korea. Visit:

The Women´s Initiative for Education and Economic Empowerment (WIFE) is a new concept and the first of its kind to be implemented by Global Unification-The Gambia; however, the association had wide experience in pro-poor advocacy and enhancing community-driven poverty alleviation efforts such as community reforestation, grassroots community sensitization on malaria prevention. In all our previous activities we have had high community response.

Our Mission
In co-operation with other Institutions, our mission is to excel in delivering the best educational skills and practices to individuals and groups to accelerate sustainable development in The Gambia.

Our Objective:
 Our objective is to improve the capacity and efficiency of individuals and groups, in the delivering of quality services, utilizing local and international best practices and standards, to meet the needs of our local communities.
GU integrates professionals, institutions, and organizations with the latest available technology in systems and applications, designed specially to improve performance in acceleration of sustainable development in poor communities in the Gambia

Our vision
 We believe in the unity of mankind – that all people matter, and that the world is run under one system, as one planet, ensuring mankind’s survival. We believe that the word ¨Poverty¨ should be removed from our dictionary and that there should no longer be poor countries or poor people on our planet.
We believe that the differences between us, which make life interesting, and that we should cherish these differences, not ignore them.

Our Priority Programs: 
To achieve our objectives, we have divided our work into five priority programs called domains. These are: 
1. Education & Training ( focus on ICT, Career counselling for youth, enterprneurial and skill development for women etc) 
2. Gender & Women rights (focus on: HIV/AIDS, Gender Based Violence and FGM) 
3 Environment & Climate Change 
4. Health ( focus on: Malaria, HIV/AIDS and reproductive health)

Het zorgde ervoor dat veel ouders stierven aan deze ziekte. Daardoor bleven veel kinderen, soms ook HIV geïnfecteerd, alleen achter. Alleen, zonder hulp en niet in staat om naar school te gaan. Ze missen mensen en organisaties die voor hen zorgen en hen een slaapplaats, eten en medicijnen geven. Naast deze weeskinderen zijn er ook heel veel straatkinderen die geen hulp hebben. Zonder hulp hebben deze kinderen geen kans om iets van hun toekomst te maken.

Het Nusuru Yatima weeshuis in Bukoba is in 1998 opgezet door Mevr. Khadija Khalfan. Ze nam haar kleindochter Fauzia Hussein (7 jaar) in huis nadat haar dochter aan aids was gestorven. Niet lang daarna stierven twee broers van haar aan aids. En kreeg ze nog eens 7 kinderen extra in huis.

Vanaf die tijd vielen haar de weeskinderen op die door de straten van Bukoba zwierven. Ze voelde zich erg betrokken en wilde hen helpen. Ze besloot haar eigen huis te gebruiken en nodigde de kinderen uit, om bij haar te komen wonen. Ze kreeg wat hulp van mensen, bedrijven en een aantal overheidinstanties, zodat er voedsel op tafel kwam. Er wonen nu 37 weeskinderen bij haar in huis.

Van die 37 weeskinderen krijgt de helft primair onderwijs en de andere helft gaat nog steeds naar de kleuterschool. Zeker 80% van de weeskinderen heeft beide ouders verloren, en 20% mist 1 van de ouders.

Het weeshuis staat geregistreerd bij de overheid. Er is een commissie bestaande uit een voorzitter, een secretaris, een penningmeester en twee commissieleden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:44.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Het weeshuis is officieel geregistreerd in Bukoba,","","","113784570","","","Weeshuis Bukoba","","None","9","2008-02-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Centro de Encontro heeft 4 sectoren: Onderwijs (armenschool en straatschool met in totaal 1500 leerlingen), Sport (jongens en meisjes teams), AIDS voorlichting en Muziek (eigen rapgroep). Men werkt in de binnenstad en district 4 van de stad Maputo, Mozambique.

Het is een onafhankelijke plaatselijke NGO erkend door het Ministerie van Onderwijs en werd opgericht in 1994 door Rene Boezaard en in 2000 overgedragen aan de plaatselijke staf.

De armenschool Centro de Encontro is een Lagere School voor arme kinderen uit district 4 van de stad Maputo en is een gratis.De armenschool (ragged school) is gevestigd in de wijk Laulane in district 4. Allerlei vereisten van bijvoorbeeld een staatsschool zoals een schooluniform en schoenen zijn bij ons niet van toepassing. Er zijn ongeveer 1100 leerlingen, evenveel meisjes als jongens. Er is een dagopleiding voor kleine kinderen (5 jaar) maar ook een avondopleiding (3 jaar) bedoeld als tweedekans onderwijs voor jongeren met 300 leerlingen. De laatste groep moet wel een kleine bijdrage betalen omdat we energiekosten hebben. De armenschool heeft sinds 1998 een eigen bibliotheek om het lezen te stimuleren, dit is niet alleen voor de eigen kinderen maar ook voor de jeugd van district 4. Ook hebben we nog een straatschool voor straatkinderen in de binnenstad van Maputo gevestigd in een huurpand dichtbij de markt  Xipamanine waar deze straatkinderen leven. Deze kinderen krijgen een normaal onderwijsprogramma maar daarnaast worden extra lessen gegeven over AIDS en andere SOA`s en kinderrechten. De straatkinderen krijgen te eten en zo nu en dan kleding. Ook regelen we identiteitsbewijzen en bezoeken we de families van deze kinderen om de oorzaken van het weglopen te onderzoeken. We helpen zo`n 70 straatkinderen.
We hebben dit jaar (2008) ook extra aandacht voor kansarme meisjes die door hun gebrekkige opleiding geen kans maken op de arbeidsmarkt. Door het aanbieden van cursussen en het begeleiden naar de arbeidsmarkt hebben we in 2008 30 meisjes kunnen helpen.

De voetbalschool Leeuwen van Laulane  (opgericht in 1995)heeft een jongens en een meisjes afdeling en we organiseren toernooien voor honderden kinderen uit het district ook van andere clubs uit de regio.
We hebben eigen regioselecties met spelers uit district 4 voor jongens en meisjes die in de eigen toernooien meespelen maar ook in andere competitiies mogen spelen in de stad. Voorts helpen we andere lokale amateurclubjes met het trainen van de kinderen en de organisatie en met het uitnodigen van de teams van deze clubjes om deel te nemen aan onze toernooien. Zo speelt onze voetbalschool een belangrijke rol in het aanbieden van sportactiviteiten in onze regio. 
Ons eerste elftal (jongens) heeft dit voetbalseizoen gedebuteerd in de 3de profliga als enige amateurclub onder de naam Nova Alianca en is op de 9de plaats geeindigd. De jongens uit dit eerste elftal helpen als vrijwilliger bij het organiseren van de sportactiviteiten in de regio als trainer, scheidsrechter of elftalleider. Het zijn dus vrijwilligers die omdat ze op hoog niveau mogen voetballen iets terug doen voor de kinderen uit hun eigen buurt. Dat is onze projectfilosofie. Door de 1% Club actie heeft de C1 nieuwe outfits kunnen aanschaffen.

De AIDS activisten zijn vrijwilligers/jongeren voornamelijk afkomstig van de bovengenoemde voetbalschool  die de eigen doelgroep voorlichten over AIDs en andere SOA `s.
Ze hebben eigen folders gemaakt en toneelstukjes geschreven waarmee men de scholen in district 4 bezoekt om tijdens de lessen sexuele voorlichting en AIDS voorlichting te geven. Ook wordt uitgelegd hoe voorbehoedsmiddelen werken en de leerlingen krijgen geregeld gratis condooms van onze AIDS activisten. Ook zijn zij actief tijdens de eigen voetbaltoernooien en de competitiewedstrijden van ons eerste team in de 3de profliga om folders en condooms uit te delen aan het publiek. Deze activiteit bestaat sinds 1998.

De rapgroep Genios Fidalgos bestaat sinds 2000 en  maakt liedjes over de problemen van de mozambikaanse jeugd en heeft met een liedje over straatkinderen de eerste plaats op de plaatselijke hitparade bereikt. Zie www.youtube.com tag Centro de Encontro + criancas abandonadas. Ook treden ze geregeld op in discotheken en op scholen. Hun nieuwste liedje gaat over de gevaren van drugs.

Ontstaan stichting: In 1993 maakte Antoinette Termoshuizen een fietstocht van Indonesië naar Nederland om geld in te zamelen voor Stichting Liliane Fonds. In het dorpje Falsathia te Bangladesh, ontmoette ze het jongetje Sayed. Sayed was spastisch aan zowel armen als benen, volledig afhankelijk van zijn zus en moeder en omdat deze niet altijd tijd hadden om hem ergens naar toe te brengen, bracht hij veel tijd door in het huis. Antoinette beloofde hem te komen helpen. In 1995 vertrok ze naar Bangladesh om een Kinderdagcentrum op te zetten voor kinderen met een motorische, verstandelijke of meervoudige handicap.In de afgelopen jaren zijn er drie dagcentra gerealiseerd waar ruim 180 kinderen aangepast aan hun niveau en mogelijkheden ADL-training (Algemeen Dagelijks Leven), sensorische integratie, preschoolse activiteiten, fysiotherapie, muziekles en handvaardigheid aangeboden krijgen. Daarnaast heeft Stichting Niketan in nauwe samenwerking met partnerorganisatie DRRA, (praktijk) onderwijs, consultatiebureaus ambulante zorg en een zorgboerderij met woonvoorziening ontwikkelt.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:53.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Noah works through community initiatives called arks, we provide the knowledge,skills and confidence to enable the communities to look after the orphaned and vulnerable children.
Rather than being limited to a physical structure,an Ark is a network of of accountable and synergistic people armed with the skills and confidence to care for its OVC.

 Noah‟s model is one that starts with an approach by a community to Noah to assist them to care for their OVC. Noah assists in the formation of a committee of community leaders to focus on the children. They are trained in the needs of children and in turn recruit a volunteer group who are trained and then register OVC in their community. Volunteers continually monitor the circumstances of the children and refer them to the appropriate agency as needed. The final pillar of an Ark is a dedicated resource center from which programmes  and services are rolled out.
At Noah, OVC programme interventions involve activities aimed at improving the lives of children and families infected and/or affected by HIV. The emphasis is on strengthening communities to meet the needs of OVC, supporting community-based responses, helping children and adolescents meet their own needs, and creating a supportive social environment for these children. The communities are our greatest supporters and believers in our model.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered section 21 companies Act NPO 021/091

In Ghana bestaan nauwelijks geschikte leerplekken voor deze kinderen, en het is moeilijk om hen te re-integreren in de samenleving. SAP biedt een dagprogramma voor kinderen die doorverwezen worden door andere projecten. Zij onvangen speciaal (individueel) onderwijs, begeleiding in gedrag en emotionele ondersteuning. SAP probeert een plek te zijn waar kinderen niet afgerekend worden op hun problemen, maar de tijd krijgen om te leren en zorg en aandacht te ervaren.
SAP is nu bijna twee jaar oud, en ontstaan vanuit een ander straatkinderenproject in Accra. Dat project bereidde voornamelijk kinderen voor op terugkeer naar school of een praktijkopleiding. Dit bleek voor een deel van de kinderen te moeilijk, en onderzoek wees uit dat het ging om kinderen met leer- en gedragsproblemen. Daarvoor is SAP toen opgericht. Inmiddels is het dagprogramma goed ontwikkeld, en er werken drie leraren die getraind zijn om deze kinderen les te geven. Sinds kort is er ook een part time sociaal werker in dienst die de families van de kinderen op zoekt en ook op de straat nieuwe kinderen ontmoet.    
SAP is nu gevestigd in North Kaneshie, dat is een wijk net buiten het centrum van Accra. De meeste kinderen verblijven rond Kaneshie Market, ongeveer een half uur lopen van SAP. Dat is een van de grootste markten van Accra, waar een groot busstation naast ligt. Dit is een plek waar kinderen werk kunnen vinden. SAP wil graag verhuizen naar een centraler deel van Accra zodat ook kinderen uit andere delen van Accra kunnen komen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:19.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Non Governmental Organisation (NGO)

De Stichting wil zich in eerste instantie gaan richten op hulpverlening aan kinderen in India, en later eventueel in ontwikkelingslanden wereldwijd. 

Het eerste project wat wij gaan ondersteunen is het ""Red de straatkinderen"" project van onze Indiase partner, de N.G.O. (Non-governmental organization) Sameeksha. Het eerste onderdeel uit dit project (wat is opgebouwd uit meerdere projecten, die elk als een op zichzelfstaand project kunnen worden uitgevoerd) wat wij willen gaan realiseren is het ‘Mobiele school voor straatkinderen’ project.

De aanleiding van het oprichten van ChildRightNow was een vakantie van Thomas van den Berg (secretaris) en Michiel van der Boom (oprichter/voorzitter) aan India. 
India heeft, zoals sommigen onder u wellicht weten,een enorm rijke cultuur, welke tegelijkertijd overschaduwd word door een deprimerende armoede onder het overgrote deel van de bevolking. Het zien van het (onnodige) lijden van, in het bijzonder de kinderen, van de Indiase bevolking greep vooral Michiel behoorlijk aan. Hierdoor onstond bij hem het verlangen om hier ‘iets aan te doen’. 

Bij een bezoek aan een tempel in Berhampur (Ganjam distrikt, Orissa) later die dag, sprak hij zijn verlangen uit tegenover de plaatselijke tempel manager. Niet lang hierna werd Michiel, door deze manager, voorgesteld aan Mevr. Anima Mishra, de secretaris van de N.G.O. Sameeksha. Zij hebben aan de hand van het daarop volgende gesprek, waar overigens niet direct concrete plannen uit voort kwamen, contact  gehouden en de rest is geschiedenis. De Stichting ChildRightNow International nam geboorte en zet zich heden ten dage, met veel enthousiasme en met een steeds groter wordende groep vrijwilligers, in  ter ondersteuning van Sameeksha’s ontwikkelings-activiteiten. ChildRightNow geeft hier invulling aan middels het werven van fondsen en het houden van voorlichtingsactiviteiten in, in eerste instantie, Nederland. 

(nieuwtje: Enkele vrienden in Zwitserland hebben ChildRightNow International CH opgezet en de stichting is ook daar reeds geregistreerd bij de notaris. We zullen samen voor hetzelfde project gaan collecteren).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:33.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvK Amsterdam 34352302, in bezit van A.N.B.I. status","info@childrightnow.nl","ING Bank","P4809646","NL12INGB0004809646","INGBNL2A","Stichting ChildRightNow International","Dorpsstraat 87","Netherlands","385","2010-02-10","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

•	Stichting El Divi heeft als doel het verbeteren van de leefomstandigheden van kansarme mensen in Honduras. Het project ‘voor gelijkspel’ van Stichting El Divi houdt in: het aanleg van een voetbalveld in het dorp El Divisadero. 
De behoefde om te sporten in El Divisadero bestaat, maar door het gebrek aan goede voorzieningen wordt hen de mogelijkheid ontnomen. Door scholen gebruikt te laten maken van het sportveld, willen wij een sportcultuur kweken. Wij laten de kinderen ervaren dat sport plezier, sociale contacten en gezondheid brengt. Daarnaast word een lokale voetbalcompetitie gehouden, waar verenigingen uit de hele omgeving aan deelnemen. Dit zal veel bezoekers aantrekken. 
Naast het bieden van sportvoorzieningen heeft Stichting El Divi een nevendoel. Er zijn in El Divisadero een aantal alleenstaande moeders die moeite hebben met rond komen. Wij willen deze moeders steunen door een kiosk op het veld door hen te laten runnen. Hierdoor hebben zij een inkomen en komen zij met elkaar in contact


De naam El Divi

De naam el Divi is een afkorting van de plaatsnaam El Divisadero. El Divisadero is een prachtig dorp in de bergen van Honduras, bereikbaar via een lange zandweg vol kuilen. El Divisadero betekent uitzichtpunt. In El Divisadero beginnen we ons eerste project, en dit dorp zal vervolgens het uitzichtpunt zijn vanwaaruit we verder zullen werken in omringende dorpen. Wij werken eraan om El Divisadero en omringende dorpen een mooi uitzicht te bieden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting :

"001J000000sncfkIAA","false","","Stichting Panabokke","","","","Winia's Reed 6","Ee","","9131 EB","Netherlands","","","","","","0519518333","","","http://www.countrygarden.nl/projects","","","","","","","Doel organisatie:                                                          De Stichting Panabokke is opgericht, omdat jongeren op Sri Lanka na hun 16e nauwelijks perspectief op scholing en werk hebben. Ze helpen meestal mee op het land of in het familiebedrijf. Zijn werkeloos of wachten - vooral de meisjes - op het huwelijk. Het doel van de stichting is om lokale jongeren en vrouwen de mogelijkheid te geven zich breed te scholen, zodat de jongeren meer kansen hebben op de lokale arbeidsmarkt. 

De Stichting is opgericht naar aanleiding van  diverse bezoeken aan Sri Lanka sinds 2000. Steeds duidelijker werd, dat het schoolsysteem in Sri Lanka maar beperkt toegankelijk is en vooral voor jongeren na het 16e jaar. Om te beginnen is het door de overheid geboden basisonderwijs – van je 4e tot je 16e jaar -  kwalitatief niet hoogstaand. Ouders die geld hebben sturen hun kinderen dan ook ’s middags na schooltijd - na 14.00 uur - naar een  privéschool of laten aan huis privélessen geven. Na het 16e jaar zijn de kosten voor veel families verdere studie of scholing onbetaalbaar hoog. Bovendien is de selectie voor openbaar onderwijs zwaar en speelt vriendjespolitiek een rol om een plek op een universiteit – het enige vervolgonderwijs - te krijgen. Daarnaast floreert privéonderwijs wat erg duur is. 

Omdat mevr. Swart, mededirecteur van Country Group International VOF in Ee, 25 jaar als docent, coördinator, als landelijk adviseur vmbo, mbo en hbo onderwijs en als wethoudersaccount bij onderwijs betrokken is geweest en de toegankelijkheid van onderwijs als een basisprincipe beschouwt, groeide het idee om een jongerenproject te starten en om op deze manier  iets voor jongeren in Sri Lanka te doen.

Het Stichtingsbestuur bestaat uit 3 personen:      
Dr. Krista Okma,                          voorzitter stichtingsbestuur (werkzaam als senior adviseur bij het Ned. Jeugd Instituut in Utrecht).                          

Drs. Sjoerd Veenstra,                          secretaris stichtingsbestuur (werkzaam bij internationaal bemiddelingsbureau, antropoloog).       

Dhr. Tjebbe Swart,                             penningmeester stichtingsbestuur (werkzaam als directeur Country Group International VOF). 
Het Stichtingsbestuur legt verantwoording af aan de partnerorganisaties zowel inhoudelijk als financieel. En ondersteunt op basis van een brede kennis en ervaring het jongerenproject.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:59.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting Panabokke opgericht bij notariskantoor Hellema te Dokkum op 7 april 2010

Zij zetten zich op allerlei manieren in voor mensen die leven met HIV/Aids. Gericht op de Wakiso district, waar het kantoor ook gevestigd is. Ze zijn in 2001 begonnen met een aantal mensen als een zelf-hulp groep voor mensen die leven met HIV/AIDS. Nu hebben ze meer dan 300 cliënten waaraan ze o.a. trainingen geven, ze organiseren samen met andere organisaties gratis HIV/Aids testen  in de buurt, geven psychosociale hulpverlening, alles eigenlijk om de draagkracht van deze groep te vergroten.
KIFAD heeft een raad van bestuur die bestaat uit 7 leden, waarvan 4 vrouwen. Het secretariaat, wat ook de technische arm is van de organisatie, wordt geleid door een full time Programme Manager en 3 andere medewerkers, namelijk de HIV/AIDS coördinator (dat ben ik; Susie, op het moment), the Community Development Officer en de accountant. KIFAD heeft 40 vrijwilligers die zich inzetten om HIV/AIDS initiatieven in de gemeenschap te ondersteunen.

Ik (Susie) ben in contact gekomen met KIFAD nadat ik me had aangemeld bij een vrijwilligersorganisatie in Nederland Stichting Internationale vrijwilligersprojecten (SIW), die contacten heeft met een zusterorganisatie in Oeganda, Uganda Pioneers Association (UPA) en die heeft me weer doorgesluisd naar KIFAD.

Thus, they decided to combine their efforts to support themselves and their communities.

Zoals scholing voor 800 kinderen, bouw bibliotheken, zorg voor straatkinderen, traffickingslachtoffers en kinderen die het slachtoffer zijn van rampen, zoals in Aceh, Yogjakarta en nu Padang. 

Voor hen bouwden en bouwen wij scholen, huizen en andere voorzieningen.  
Aanvankelijk lag het zwaartepunt van de activiteiten in het opzetten van medische projecten zoals het bouwen en inrichten van een ziekenhuis, het opzetten en inrichten van dialyseklinieken, gratis cataractoperaties voor de armen, HIV-Aidsprojecten, voorlichting, counseling en behandeling en hepatitis-B preventie en vaccinatieprojecten.

In Bandung ondersteunen we beroepsopleidingen voor jonge vrouwen zodat zij een tweede kans krijgen op inkomen en hun kinderen weer naar school kunnen laten gaan. Via ons adoptieprogramma ondersteunen we bijna 1000 kinderen om hun scholing te financieren.

Als kind heb je niets te kiezen en groei je op zonder toekomst. Er heerst nog veel analfabetisme ondanks het feit dat Ghana veel investeert in educatie.

Cariquitan en Peter ter Heegde in januari 2005 Stichting LUCS in het leven geroepen. Al in 2002 waren zij begonnen met de opvang van kansarme kinderen vanuit hun eigen huisje op Malapascua, een klein eilandje ten westen van Cebu. 

Als erkende stichting kan LUCS momenteel een beroep doen op Nederlandse sponsoren. Aangezien er in de stad nu eenmaal betere scholen en overige faciliteiten voor de kinderen zijn, is Stichting LUCS in 2006 van Malapascua naar Cebu City verhuisd. In april 2008 heeft de Stichting een stuk land gekocht in de wijk To-Ong, met het doel meer kinderen op te kunnen vangen. Op het land is een ruim onderkomen gebouwd waar de kinderen onder het toeziend oog van een Filippijnse huismoeder in een zo normaal mogelijk gezinsverband kunnen opgroeien. 

De Stichting LUCS bestaat in Nederland sinds 2005 en word voor de dagelijkse zaken gerund door: 
Voorzitter (Aart van der Staaij), 
Penningmeester/Secretaris (Karin Speijer) 
Boekhouder (Jaap Ruis).

Hier genoemd als laatste maar zonder enige twijfel de belangrijkste spil in de organisatie is:  Jasmin F. Cariquitan (18jan 1969, Cebu).Op de Filippijnen is zij als projectmanager verantwoordelijk voor de dagelijkse gang van zaken. Jasmin is zelf opgegroeid in de wijk Buhisan. Deze wijk ligt halverwege de steile weg naar het verderop gelegen To-Ong. Al vanaf negenjarige leeftijd werkte zij in diverse bijbaantjes om haar school te kunnen betalen. Een van die bijbaantjes was bijvoorbeeld hout sprokkelen in het bos van To-Ong. Dit is een activiteit die nog steeds door veel kansarme kinderen uit deze omgeving dagelijks wordt gedaan om mee te helpen in het levensonderhoud van de familie. Op latere leeftijd had zij als alleenstaande moeder de verantwoording voor drie  opgroeiende kinderen. Zonder verdere educatieve achtergrond schopte zij het in Manilla toch zover als hoofd delegatie van het Nationaal Filippijnse Team gewichtheffen. Ondanks de harde lessen uit haar jeugd en de zorg voor haar eigen kinderen wist zij altijd weer een mouw te passen en een buurmeisje of –jongen te helpen hun school af te maken. Haar droom is altijd geweest om méér kinderen in haar omgeving een eerlijke kans te geven zich te ontwikkelen door naar school te gaan en een diploma te halen. In 2002 werkte zij als manicuriste op Malapascua eiland waar zij Peter leerde kennen.

Momenteel is zij als Projectmanager verantwoordelijk voor het dagelijks runnen van de stichting. Dit houdt onder meer in dat zij de rekening beheert, een maandelijks cash report opstuurt aan Karin in Nederland en als een ware moeder Teresa een warm hart heeft voor de kinderen.  Met haar inzet voor de kinderen is zij een toonbeeld van overlevingskracht voor de kinderen hoe je ondanks de slechte omstandigheden toch kunt overleven en een doel aan je leven geven. Dat zij in haar goedheid soms teveel mensen wil helpen is dan ook het meest negatieve wat ik hier over haar kan melden. Naast het dagelijks runnen van het ""LUCS gezin"" is zij mede verantwoordelijk voor de inbedding van het project in de lokale gemeenschap, de contacten met de overheid en de samenwerking met andere lokale organisaties. Met name bij deze laatste taak zou zij nog wel wat hulp kunnen gebruiken dus als er nog mensen zijn die goede en betrouwbare vrijwilligers op de Filippijnen weten houden wij ons van harte aanbevolen.

Aart van der Staaij (2 juni 1949, Rotterdam) is een duik vriend van Peter ter Heegde en is vanaf het eerste moment betrokken geweest bij het project maar pas sinds begin 2008 officieel als voorzitter van LUCS in Nederland. Met zijn eigen bedrijf  ""Zorgelan"" verzorgt hij o.m. HKZ certificeringen in de Zorg. Hierbij komt zijn achtergrond als directeur van een grote zorginstelling goed van pas. Via zijn bedrijf is hij een groot sponsor van LUCS en doet binnen en buiten zijn klantenkring aan sponsorwerving voor LUCS. In de afgelopen jaren heeft hij meerdere malen de Filippijnen bezocht. Lees het verslag over zijn laatste bezoek in onze nieuwsbrief van Maart 2009.

Karin Speijer (25 mei 1964, Oostburg) heeft in November 2006 als klant van AquAmazing Philippines een duikreis naar de Filippijnen geboekt en heeft tijdens deze reis ook ons project bezocht. (Lees haar verslag op de website van AquAmazingphilippines.nl)  Inmiddels is zij naast enthousiast sponsor als secretaris en penningmeester o.m. verantwoordelijk voor alle geldzaken van de Stichting. Een taak die haar perfect ligt aangezien zij in het dagelijks leven unitmanager is bij de ABN AMRO. Op haar werk is zij zeer uitgesproken over haar nevenactiviteiten en dat heeft er onder meer in geresulteerd dat de keuken van ons nieuwe onderkomen door haar collega's is gesponsord.

Jaap Ruis (24 mei 1946, Naaldwijk) is boekhouder van de Stichting LUCS en verzorgt aan de hand van de aangeleverde stukken onder meer de jaarcijfers en dergelijke. Een taak die ook hem prima ligt aangezien hij via zijn eigen bedrijfje ""Ministratie"" voor verschillende bedrijven de administratie en boekhouding verzorgt.

Peter ter Heegde (13 november 1967, Den Haag)  maakt als oprichter van de Stichting nog wel deel uit van het bestuur maar heeft sinds begin 2008 geen dagelijkse functie. Hier is bewust naar toe gewerkt om ook naar sponsoren die ons minder goed kennen iedere schijn van belangenverstrengeling te voorkomen. Naast het duiken (zie mijn profiel op de 1% pagina) verzorg ik de nieuwsbrieven voor de stichting, doe sponsorwerving en beheer nieuwe projecten zoals bijvoorbeeld de 1% club).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:05.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","ANBI stichting,

Ik werd begeleid door George Nyamor, die op dat moment bezig was te promoveren. Nadat ik klaar was met mijn onderzoek, keerde ik terug naar Nederland en bleef contact onderhouden met George. 

Ook bleef ik contact houden met iemand anders, namelijk Roselyne. Roselyne is een jonge vrouw van mijn leeftijd, die ik in de sloppenwijken van Kisumu leerde kennen. In tegenstelling tot het werk dat ik deed, zorgde zij voor 15 kinderen die geen ouders meer hadden. Zij behoren allemaal tot haar extended-family: (zeer) verre familie. De situatie waar ik hen in 2006 aantrof was dermate slecht, dat ik besloot Roselyne zelf te blijven helpen. 

In 2007 keerde ik naar Kenya terug, en bekeek hoe het ging met de kinderen. Het ging beter met hen, dankzij de steun die zij kregen konden de kinderen naar school en waren de omstandigheden beter. Om hen, en andere kinderen in vergelijkbare situaties, beter te kunnen helpen besloot ik de 'Africa Family Foundation' op te richten. 1 december 2007 is toen de Stichting opgericht. 

Er zijn verschillende mensen betrokken bij de Stichting: Toon van der Hoorn (professor Universiteit van Amsterdam) is adviseur van de Stichting en tevens bestuurslid. Arjan Kampfraath (zelfstandig ondernemer) is secretaris, betrokken bij het ontwikkelen van projecten en tevens bestuurslid.

Hierdoor wordt het plastic afval weer bruikbaar en op deze manier wordt tevens het milieu en leefomgeving opgeschoond van de ontelbare eeuwige plastic zakjes.

Dit wil zij bewerkstelligen door de Guatemalteekse partnerorganisatie 'A.G.H. Trasciende' financieel te ondersteunen.

Esther van der Zijden, cultuurwetenschapper, nam initiatief tot het oprichten van de stichting nadat zij vanaf 2007 als vrijwilliger veel tijd doorbracht in één van de sloppenwijken van Guatemala Stad. Hier kwam ze in aanraking met een groep breakdance jongeren en raakte onder de indruk van de positieve invloed die deze dansvorm op hen had. Samen met een andere vrijwilligster organiseerde ze vervolgens in haar wijk een serie breakdanceworkshops van tien weken gedurende de Guatemalteekse zomervakantie. 
Ze besloot dat ze meer jongeren, ook uit andere wijken , wilde bereiken en ging op zoek naar professionele hiphopartiesten die haar hierbij zouden kunnen helpen. Ze zocht contact met een aantal beeldbepalende artiesten binnen de hiphopcultuur en al snel bleek dat een aantal van hen met hetzelfde idee rondliep: een breakdanceschool in Guatemala Stad oprichten. Eind 2008 begonnen de eerste leden met vergaderen en in februari 2009 werd de Asociación Guatemalteca de artistas del Hiphop Trasciende (A.G.H. Trasciende) in het leven geroepen. Trasciende komt van het Spaanse woord ‘trascender’. Dit woord betekent ‘overstijgen’ of een bepaalde limiet doorbreken. Voor A.G.H Trasciende betekent dit dat de jongeren meer zelfvertrouwen krijgen en mede hierdoor hoop op het realiseren van een betere toekomst. Daarnaast ‘overstijgt’ hiphop sociale, economische en culturele grenzen.

De missie van A.G.H Trasciende is:
Het ontwikkelen en inspireren van jongeren door middel van de hiphopcultuur, waarmee ze een alternatief geboden wordt voor het leven op straat en het bendelidmaatschap.
Jongeren een platform bieden om hun positieve eigenschappen en artistieke talenten aan de maatschappij te tonen, door middel van publieke evenementen en lezingen.

De Nederlandse Stichting is opgericht door Van der Zijden en het bestuur bestaat uit vier van haar enthousiaste vriendinnen (zie organogram stichting). Zelf is Van der Zijden penningmeester van de Guatemalteekse Stichting A.G.H. Trasciende.
A.G.H. Trasciende bestaat verder uit zes beeldbepalende hiphopartiesten die allen ervaring hebben met het geven van workshops en een aantal van hen was de afgelopen twee jaar verantwoordelijk voor de organisatie van een aantal grote breakdance evenementen in Guatemala Stad. De zeven bestuursleden zijn tevens verantwoordelijk voor het beheer van de school en de voorzitter, Fernando Reynoso is verantwoordelijk voor het dagelijks management.

Locatie:
Guatemala Stad wordt geplaagd door bendes. Met name in de marginale zones zijn de bendes aan de macht. Jongeren lopen een zeker risico als ze een wijk binnenkomen waar ze niet uit afkomstig zijn, omdat ze als lid van een rivaliserende bende gezien kunnen worden. Daarom heeft A.G.H. Trasciende ervoor gekozen om zich in het centrum van Guatemala Stad te vestigen. Dit is een neutrale, voor iedereen toegankelijke zone. 
Daarnaast is het centrum qua afstand het geschiktst. Door een metrolijn die de overheid in 2007 heeft aangelegd is het centrum, ook vanuit marginale wijken aan de rand van de stad, snel en goedkoop te bereiken.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:49.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Trasciende is to inspire and educate at-risk youth through the hiphop movement, providing them with an alternative to the streets and gang membership.  To fulfill this mission we have opened a breakdance school and hiphop center in the urban heart of Guatemala. It serves as a safe space where youth can showcase their positive talents and can become an active and important part of the hiphop movement. This space allows youth to be inspired, to explore their own sense of artistic expression, to build meaningful friendships and a strong sense of belonging, and to nurture the growth of their own self-confidence and self-worth. Additionally, this center has made a commitment to educate the general public on the richness and value of the hiphop movement and the positive role that youth play within this movement. 

A.G.H. Trasciende began working in February 2009. It was granted non-profit status in September 2009.  On January 8, 2010, the organization inaugurated the first ever hiphop center in Central America! Youth from around Guatemala City come to receive free classes in breakdance, dj-ing, and popping. In the years to come, A.G.H. Trasciende will also offer graffiti and mc workshops.

In 2009 A.G.H. Trasciende organized three breakdance events in Guatemala City. They pulled in 200, 1,500 and 2,000 spectators, respectively.  

Currently there are ten people working for the organization.

De organisatie is opgezet door jongeren in Kenia met epilepsie in samenwerking met mij, Karyn. Tijdens mijn studie liep ik stage in Kenia en zag ik op televisie een rapportage van een jongen met epilepsie die vastgebonden wat omdat mensen niet wisten wat ze met hem aanmoesten. Na onderzoek naar bestaande organisaties voor jongeren met epilepsie ontdekte ik dat er alleen nog maar een organisatie was die medische zorg aanbiedt, maar geen persoonlijke begeleiding. Dit motiveerde mij om Youth on the Move op te starten tijdens mijn afstudeerjaar. Hiervoor hebben wij brainstormsessies met de jongeren met epilepsie in Kenia gehouden, en vanuit hun eigen wensen en ideeën een projectvoorstel gemaakt en fondsen geworven. Het project is sinds 2007 officieel geregistreerd in Kenia als een NGO. De NGO heeft een officieel Keniaans bestuur dat maandelijks bij elkaar komt. 

De jongeren werken vanuit hun trainingscentrum in Nairobi West waar zij een klaslokaal en een cybercafe hebben. De cyber biedt jongeren de mogelijkheid om via internet ervaringen uit te wisselen met jongeren met epilepsie wereldwijd, en tegelijkertijd kunnen de jongeren met het inkomen van de cyber de huur voor de locatie betalen.

Bij YotM werken op dit moment zes mensen, maar hebben we ook 12 vrijwilligers die 3 dagen per week actief zijn. Wij hebben nu bij Youth on the Move de volgende functies:
-	2 cyber assistenten
-	1 jongerentrainer (geeft trainingen over Epilepsie en Youth Empowerment en begeleidt de jongeren bij de Movers Meeting)
-	1 jongerenbegeleider (begeleid de jongeren met huiswerk en met computergebruik, en bij hun stage op epilepsieklinieken)
-	1 directeur (voor fondsenwerving, lobby & advocacy en begeleiding van het personeel)
-	1 accountant

Noah works on franchising community-based models of care where motivated individuals from communities are guided to form their own circle of support which is referred to as an Ark. Rather than being limited to a physical structure, an Ark is a network of accountable and synergistic people armed with the skills and confidence to care for the orphaned and vulnerable children.
Noah‟s model is one that starts with an approach by a community to Noah to assist them to care for their OVC. Noah assists in the formation of a committee of community leaders to focus on the children. They are trained in the needs of children and in turn recruit a volunteer group who are trained and then register OVC in their community. Volunteers continually monitor the circumstances of the children and refer them to the appropriate agency as needed. The final pillar of an Ark is a dedicated resource centre from which programmes and services are rolled out.
We take a holistic approach to ensure that the children grow up into confident individuals with bright futures regardless of the circumstances they are born into. We support over 29,000 orphaned and vulnerable children in 101 Arks in three provinces in South Africa.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:59.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered Section 12 of the Companies Act NPO 021/901

Wij vinden dat sport en beweging van cruciaal belang is bij de sociale en fysieke revalidatie van mensen met een beperking. Daarnaast geloven wij in “The joy of movement”. Mensen hebben veel plezier tijdens het sporten en voelen zich er zichtbaar beter door. Daarom heeft Respo International als doel om zoveel mogelijk gehandicapten kennis te laten maken met recreatief sporten en bewegen, waarbij we uitgaan van de mogelijkheden die ieder mens heeft. 

Onze projecten zijn gericht op kwaliteit, maar ook op duurzaamheid en voorlichting. Het overdragen van kennis aan lokale begeleiders is een belangrijk aspect van onze aanpak, evenals emancipatie. In sommige ontwikkelingslanden worden mensen met een beperking beschouwd als nutteloos en kansloos. De projecten van Respo International bieden hun een kans om te tonen waar zij toe in staat zijn.

Respo International is in mei 2005 in Zwolle opgericht. Respo International is een stichting die voortborduurt op de roots van Stichting DS-DI, een stichting die zich inzette voor het opzetten van beweeg- en sportprogramma’s in ontwikkelingslanden. Respo International is na opheffing van de stichting DS-DI in samenwerking en met ondersteuning van Hogeschool Windesheim in Zwolle opgericht. Respo DS-DI kenmerkte zich vooral door kortstondige trainingsprogramma’s voor lokale gymdocenten en/of activiteitenleiders. Respo International richt zich als stichting op meer duurzamere samenwerkingsverbanden om  kennis te vergroten op het gebied van sport en bewegen voor mensen met een handicap en daadwerkelijk de kennis in te bedden in de lokale infrastructuur. Dit doet zij door in de praktijk beweeg- en sportprogramma’s op te zetten<script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://www.1procentclub.nl/assets/widgets/tiny_mce/themes/advanced/langs/en.js""></script> en hieraan structurele scholingsprogramma’s te koppelen. Er werken op dit moment 7 mensen bij RESPO.

Binnen de ""Sports for All Day"" zal de uitvoer voornamelijk liggen bij onze Zuid Afrikaanse partner, Score Zuid Afrika. Bij hen zal een programmacoördinator 'aangepast sporten' in dienst komen. Hij/zij zal samen met het WCRC de ""Sport for All Day"" organiseren.

Door geld in te zamelen in Nederland, ondersteunen wij twee organisaties die al tientallen jaren de zorg voor deze kinderen op zich nemen. De kinderen krijgen opvang en opleidingsmogelijkheden en hebben daarmee kans op een betere toekomst. Naar school gaan, timmerman worden, een rijbewijs halen zijn voorbeelden van mogelijkheden die deze organisaties hen bieden.
Stichting Raja is opgericht door een groep Nederlandse vrouwen die na een periode van vrijwilligerswerk in India, terug in Nederland iets wilden blijven doen voor die kinderen met wie we samenleefden, die ons ontroerden, die ons deden schaterlachen en die ons stil lieten worden. 
Het bestuur in Nederland bestaat momenteel uit drie personen en een tiental vrijwilligers. De laatste jaren doneren wij 30.000-40.000 euro per jaar voor diverse projecten, zoals onderwijs voor straatkinderen, de opvang in tehuizen, begeleiding om naar huis terug te keren, rijbewijsopleidingen voor ex-straatjongens, om maar eens wat te noemen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:15.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Het project heeft 4 sectoren: Onderwijs (lagere school met ongeveer 1500 leerlingen) , Sport (voetbalschool voor jongens en meisjes) , AIDS voorlichting aan jongeren en Muziek (eigen rapgroep).
Het is een onafhankelijke plaatselijke NGO erkend door het Ministerie van Onderwijs en werd in 1994 opgericht door R.W.Boezaard en door hem in 2000 overgedragen aan de plaatselijke staf (voornamelijk ex straatkinderen).
De armenschool/straatschool (ragged school) is een lagere school voor de allerarmste kinderen uit de stad Maputo en is gevestigd in district 4 van de stad. Allerlei vereisten van een staatschool zoals een schooluniform en schoenen zijn bij ons niet noodzakelijk. Er is een dagopleiding (5 jaar) en een avondopleiding (3 jaar). Er zijn evenveel meisjes als jongens. Men heeft ook een eigen bibliotheek bij de school. Voor kansarme meisjes is er een vocational training programma. We bieden cursussen en stageplaatsen aan om de kansen op de arbeidsmarkt te vergroten.
De voetbalschool Leeuwen van Laulane is in 1995 opgericht en heeft een jongens en een meisjes afdeling en we organiseren toernooien voor honderden kinderen uit het district en andere clubs uit de regio. Zo speelt onze voetbalschool een belangrijke rol in het aanbieden van sportactiviteiten in het district. Het eerste elftal speelt met onze jeugdige talenten in de profliga en deze jongens zetten zich ook in als vrijwilliger bij het organiseren van toernooien en het trainen van de kleine jongens en meisjes van de wijkteams.
De AIDS activisten zijn vrijwilligers/jongeren voornamelijk afkomstig uit bovengenoemde voetbalschool die de eigen doelgroep voorlichten over AIDS en andere SOA `s. Ze hebben eigen folders gemaakt en toneelstukjes geschreven waarmee de scholen in district 4 worden bezocht en zij zijn ook actief tijdens de wedstrijden van de profliga en de door het project georganiseerde toernooien.
Deze activiteit bestaat sinds 1998.
De rapgroep Genios Fidalgos bestaat sinds 2000 en maakt liedjes over de problemen van de mozambikaanse jeugd en men heeft met een liedje over straatkinderen de eerste plaats op de plaatselijke hitparade behaald. Zie www.youtube.com tag Centro de Encontro + criancas abandonadas. Ook treden ze geregeld op in discotheken en scholen.. Vorig jaar brachten ze een liedje uit over de gevaren van drugs.

Adapted and integrated leisure activities are effective and UN recognised tools to raise awareness about disabilities and HIV/AIDS.
According to WHO estimates, 1.3 million people with disabilities live in Zimbabwe, counting for 10% (FYI: this is a general guideline which the WHO uses for developing countries) of the total population. In Zimbabwe many disabilities are related to complications during birth, especially in rural areas. Majority of individuals with disabilities face widespread violation of their fundamental freedoms and rights, exclusion from education (percentage varies between 25 and 75 exclusion rate), employment, health care and sports and are especially vulnerable to poverty, physical and sexual violence, emotional abuse and neglect. The stigma attached to disability is the cause of societies’ negative attitudes towards them.
The rights of youth and children living with disabilities and their families are still violated which results in extreme poverty and increase problems through the disability. Poor families cannot be expected to provide all the additional needs of a child with a disability without the support from state and civil society groups.  
S4S is working towards the aim of improving the quality of life and promote social inclusion of youth and children living with disabilities AND their families. Therefore S4S has developed the comprehensive multiple award winning Social Inclusion Programme with a family orientated approach. The programme consists of the following activities:
- identification, assessment and intake
- adapted and integrated leisure activities
- institutional adapted physical activities
- individual child support (corrective surgeries, medication, school fees, assistive devices)
- parent support groups
- economic empowerment / livelihood
- physiotherapy and counselling
- capacity building and training
- disability and HIV/AIDS awareness
S4S has received the following award for this Social Inclusion Programme concept:

Worldwide, over 500,000 women each year are diagnosed with this type of cancer, of which approximately 50% don’t survive the disease. Over 80% of the women live in developing countries. It often concerns young mothers who are the mainstay of the household and indispensable for the family income and local economy. When they are no longer there, this has a major impact on their family and on the village in which they live.

What makes these facts even harder to accept is that cervical cancer can be prevented and can be cured completely with timely diagnosis and treatment of the symptoms.

The Female Cancer Foundation was founded based on the ambition of taking up the challenge and fighting cervical cancer worldwide. A world free of cervical cancer. Not a utopian wish but a real goal, to be attained by providing care (screening and treatment) on site, providing education and information and carrying out research. In everything that the Female Cancer Foundation does, the main objective is to ensure that the local healthcare providers and population acquire the knowledge that they need to fight cervical cancer themselves. The work is carried out based on the train-the-trainer principle: local healthcare providers are trained to be able to spread the knowledge further in the local community.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KvK-inschrijfnummer: 34242224, Amsterdam

It was started by the following founder members among others:
1-       Ms Flavia Masika, Chairperson
2-       Ms Bisika Joseline, Secretary
3-       Ms Night Violet, Treasurer
4-       Nyabitimbwa Misulesi
5-       Musoki Scovia 
Today, the organization has 20 members of whom 18 are women and 2 are men. Our programs focus on the whole Rwenzori area, a region covering the western Ugandan districts of Kasese, Kabarole and Bundibugyo. Collectively, these three districts have a population of slightly over 1.6 million people. As of now however, most of our programs are still local in scope i.e they cover small parts of the region owing to financial constraints  although some past programs eg the Lhuyira-English bilingual dictionary project covered the whole region. 
RWICOD’s focus is to create development in the broadest sense especially through the establishment and implementation of projects that aim at transferring knowledge, skills and capacity to individuals and communities that need assistance to come out of poverty and dehumanized conditions. RWICOD works with the people as partners in finding solutions and in creating the necessary conditions to improve their living standards and to achieve their aspiration for a just and humanized life for themselves, their families and their communities. It is further RWICOD’s mission to promote humanization of man, and to protect the weak and the outcast eg women and children and to go against all forms of discrimination, oppression and exploitation. RWICOD aims to have an effect on the eradication of poverty, the control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, education for all, health care for all and for people to have the power to decide over their own destinies.
RWICOD is a non-political, non-religious organization
Basically, the General Assembly (all the 20 members) is the supreme organ of the organization. It makes decisions and resolutions during general meetings and these resolutions are implemented by the governing executive board which is elected by all the members. There are 6 persons on this board (executive). All these are volunteers to the organization’s activities. 
The executive board of RWICOD is here below:
 
1.  Mrs Flavia Masika, Chairperson (Administrative head)
2.	Ms Joseline Bisika, Secretary
3.	Ms Violet Night, Treasurer

 In 2005, tijdens haar tweede verblijf als vrijwilligster in Nepal, werd Marloes Twilt geconfronteerd met de problemen van het kindertehuis, dat toen nog op naam stond van een Nepalese mevrouw. In verband met mishandelingen van de kinderen, erbarmelijke leefomstandigheden, schulden en dergelijke, werd het tehuis gedwongen haar poorten te sluiten. Marloes (op dat moment 24 jaar oud) heeft vervolgens een huis gehuurd en volledig ingericht om alle kinderen, in de leeftijd van 4-12 jaar, op te kunnen vangen. Vanaf dat moment stond het kindertehuis, en daarmee de verantwoordelijkheid van de kinderen, op haar naam. 
De kinderen werden medisch gecontroleerd en behandeld, ontluisd, ontwormd en aangekleed. De situatie in het vorige weeshuis was dermate slecht dat slechts groepjes van 5 kinderen tegelijkertijd geaccepteerd en behandeld konden worden. De eerste groep van 5 kinderen arriveerde op 27 oktober 2005.
Alle kinderen volgden binnen enkele dagen na aankomst dagonderwijs. Het schoolhoofd en zijn vrouw (beiden Nepalezen) wonen in het tehuis en fungeren als vader- en moederfiguur. Daarnaast zijn er 3 medewerk(st)ers die in teamverband, 7 dagen per week van ’s morgens 6 uur tot ’s avonds 7 uur, aanwezig zijn voor het verrichten van alle huishoudelijke taken en maaltijdbereiding. 
Alle kinderen worden in de Nepalese taal en rekening houdende met cultuur, religie, tradities en de rechten van het kind opgevoed, opgeleid en begeleid.
Momenteel staat voor 2011 uitbreiding van het kindertehuis op de planning voor 12 kinderen met een beperking; fysiek, mentaal dan wel meervoudig. Voor deze kinderen is opvang in Nepal praktisch niet bestaand. Kinderen worden vaak verstoten (aangezien een kind met een handicap in Nepal als een schande wordt ervaren), belanden op straat, worden opgepakt, waarna veel kinderen in de gevangenis belanden omdat er nergens anders plaats is. De bedoeling is dat de kinderen die nu al wonen in het kindertehuis, betrokken worden bij de opvang van de kinderen met een beperking, om er zo aan bij te dragen dat ook deze kinderen een zonnige toekomst tegemoet kunnen gaan. Zo kunnen zij de 'nieuwe' kinderen bijvoorbeeld gaan ondersteunen in de dagelijkse bezigheden, afhankelijk van waar de beperkingen van deze kinderen liggen. Kinderen kunnen immers veel van elkaar leren.
De Langtang Children Home wordt formeel beheerd door een bestuur bestaande uit Marloes Twilt (oprichtster en voorzitster), Koen Twilt (penningmeester en secretaris), Marjolijn, Belinda en Elly Twilt (bestuursleden).

We zijn alle drie zelf vaker betrokken bij acties voor het goede doelen. Zo ben ik samen met Remco in 2005 voor de Amsterdam Dakar Challange naar Gambia gereden om een auto te doneren aan een plaatselijk goed doel. Ook heb ik recent de 1%Club geholpen met het organiseren en produceren van hun jaarlijkse 1%Event. Morris is bestuur is bestuurslid van Stichting mijn huis in Ipauratu Colombia. De stichting waar we ons voor in gaan zetten. De mensen achter de stichting in zowel Nederland als in Colombia ken ik persoonlijk al ruim 20 jaar. 

Stichting ""Mijn huis in IPAURATU Colombia"" heeft als doelstelling om een positieve bijdrage te leveren aan de leefomstandigheden van de minder bedeelden in het Colombiaanse dorp Paluato (voorheen Ipauratu). Dit doet zij door voor de korte termijn te voorzien in eerste levensbehoeften en voor de lange termijn door ervoor te zorgen dat mensen in eigen levensonderhoud kunnen voorzien. De doelstelling wordt gerealiseerd door:
• Het bieden van basisbehoefte en basisvoorzieningen (voedsel, medische zorg  en educatie)
• Het ondersteunen van lokale initiatieven door het verstrekken van financiële middelen of goederen
• Het creëren van werkgelegenheid
• Het creëren van bewustzijn en het genereren van steun in Nederland en Colombia.

De stichting is eind 2009 opgericht en zet zich in om de leefomstandigheden voor de minder bedeelden in het dorp Paluato (voorheen Ipauratu) Colombia te verbeteren. De focus voor de aankomende jaren ligt op het mogelijk maken van onderwijs voor kleuters","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:24.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting met ANBI status

MRDA vertelde over de vraag van de jongeren in Mundri naar een project speciaal gericht op de jeugd. Dit in combinatie met het gebrek aan gezondheidsvoorzieningen en kennis waren de grondbeginselen
voor het project Mpower!. Gezien de grote financiële omvang van het project  (budget ca 50.000 euro) werd dit ondergebracht in een aparte stichting genaamd Mpower Foundation.

In juni 2007 is in Mundri, Zuid-Soedan het Mpower! project van start gegaan; een
gezondheidsvoorlichtingprogramma, met als hoofdthema’s: voeding, seksuele & reproductieve gezondheid, gender en hygiëne & sanitatie, wat een samenwerking tussen Nederlandse geneeskunde studenten aangesloten bij IFMSA-NL en MRDA was. Het project had als eindproduct een groep van 60 trainers in de eerder genoemde onderwerpen. Doel van de trainers was het verspreiden van de
gezondheidsboodschap door middel van workshops en huis visites. Ten tijde van vertrek van de Nederlandse geneeskunde studenten in december 2008, resteerde er echter nog grote vragenover de zorg voor kinderen.

In 2008 is Mpower!Kids project van start gegaan; wederom als samenwerking tussen IFMSA-NL en MRDA. In de periode juli-oktober 2008 hebben Nederlandse studenten een geselecteerde groepMpower! trainers verder getraind in onderwerpen gerelateerd aan kindergezondheid. Op 6 oktober 2008 is de Mundri Under 5 Clinic geopend. Dankzij deze kliniek heeft de regio Mundri nu de hoogste vaccinatiegraad van heel Zuid Soedan. De kliniek is helaas overgenomen door een andere organisatie en is niet meer actief. De Mpower!kids trainers hebben hun activiteiten wel doorgezet maar zonder vaste locatie.

Alle activiteiten van Mpower! en Mpower!Kids zijn ondergebracht bij de ‘health department’ van MRDA. Een aantal van de Mpower trainers werken bij MRDA als HIV/AIDS en health promotors en EPI field assistents. Zij dragen gezamenlijk de verantwoordelijkheid voor de continuïteit van alle activiteiten. De werkzaamheden van de Mpower trainers bestaan uit het voortzetten van de Mpower (Kids) activiteiten –gezondheidszorg voor kinderen jonger dan vijf en de empowerment van de lokale
bevolking op het gebied van gezondheid.

In 2010 hebben leden van het Nederlands bestuur ook een trainingsprogramma verzorgd voor mensen in Lui, een nabij gelegen dorp. Deze jongeren zullen het werkgebied van de activiteiten vergroten door ook in hun dorp de activiteiten uit te voeren. Hopelijk zullen hun werkzaamheden in de toekomst plaatsvinden vanuit een nieuwe, Under 5 Clinic (consultatiebureau), die de mogelijkheid heeft uit te groeien tot een klein kinderziekenhuis.

Naast de activiteiten in Zuid Soedan  is Mpower Foundation ook actief op het gebied van awareness raising in Nederland. Wij schrijven 4 maal per jaar een nieuwsbrief met updates over de  actualiteiten en Mpower activiteiten in Zuid Soedan. Met deze nieuwsbrief bereiken wij ruim 500 geinteresseerden. In Oktober 2011 hebben wij het Bricks and Babies event georganiseerd. Op dit event lichtte wij onze acitviteiten toe en waren er verschillende workshops over ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Dit event was volledig uitverkocht en bracht ook ruim 8000 euro op. Verder bezoeken wij meerdere malen per jaar scholen en congressen om te spreken/ discusseren over de situatie in Zuid Soedan en de toekomst.

Doelstellingen: 
De stichting heeft Statutair ten doel:
1. het bevorderen en bewaken van de gezondheid en gezondheidszorg in Afrika, alsmede het onderhouden van contacten voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking tussen Nederland en Afrika en het verrichten van alle verdere handelingen, die met het vorenstaande in de ruimste zin verband houden of daartoe bevorderlijk kunnen zijn.
2. De stichting tracht haar doel onder meer te verwezenlijken door Nederlandse en Afrikaanse jongeren met elkaar in contact te brengen, door gezamenlijk een programma te ontwikkelen en activiteiten als lezingen, debatten en andere bijeenkomsten te organiseren in Nederland, alsmede door al hetgeen met vorenstaand verband houdt of daartoe bevorderlijk kan zijn, een en ander in de ruimste zin.


Werkwijze en samenstelling Mpower Foundation in Nederland:
In 2010 heeft Mpower Foundation zich afgescheiden van IFMSA-NL om zich specifiek te kunnen
richten op de programma’s in Zuid Soedan. De Nederlandse stichting werkt vanaf heden geheel op vraag van de partner organisatie MRDA. In de toekomst zal Mpower Foundation de  twee programma’s blijven ondersteunen. Het eerste programma richt zich op het behoud van de activiteiten die primaire  gezondheidszorg bieden voor kinderen jonger dan vijf jaar. Het tweede programma richt zich op empowerment van de lokale jeugd. Dit wordt getracht te bereiken door workshops te geven, discussie aan te gaan met lokale leiders, huis visites te doen en schoolclubs op te richten. Mpower Foundation tracht met haar activiteiten bij te dragen aan het behalen van Millenium Development Goals 3,4,5 en 6.

Mpower Foundation is een rechtspersoon die wordt bestuurd door een vrijwillig bestuur.
Bestuursleden zijn niet in loondienst en ontvangen enkel een vergoeding voor gemaakte onkosten.
Activiteiten en werkzaamheden worden uitgevoerd door de bestuursleden; de stichting heeft geen commissies, maar beschikt wel over een groot bestand met geinteresseerden. Mpower Foundation wil een transparante, inspirerende en betrouwbare stichting in Nederland zijn die net als haar partner organisatie MRDA gelijkwaardige, duurzame ontwikkeling bevordert in een vreedzaam Zuid Soedan, met als aandachtspunten kindergezondheid en empowerment van de jeugd.

We denken hierbij bijvoorbeeld aan klimaatverandering en armoede. We zien het resultaat van deze ontwikkelingen op aarde elke dag om ons heen en op tv.

We kunnen diegenen die minder kansen hebben helpen! Balinese kinderen uit wees en kindertehuizen hebben elke dag te maken met armoede, weinig kwalitatieve onderwijsvoorzieningen en werkeloosheid.

Door de kinderen meer te leren over de omgeving waarin ze leven kunnen ze zich leren te ontwikkelen in die omgeving. De kinderen krijgen nadat zij educatief materiaal hebben doorgewerkt de kans zich te ontwikkelen in het surfen en daardoor de elementen van moeder natuur te leren kennen op een sportieve manier. Daarmee kunnen we een netwerk opbouwen om een baan te vinden in de commerciële surfscene op Bali.

Voor de getalenteerde jongeren wordt extra support en begeleiding verzorgd zodat ze een voorbeeld voor anderen kunnen zijn, en anderen bewust kunnen maken hoe belangrijk het behouden en beschermen van hun leefomgeving is.

Door het surfprogramma hebben we een kans de kinderen uit het wees of kindertehuis te halen en ze meer te leren over natuurbescherming.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:48.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

I am a consultant in developmental work in developing countries, specialized in solar energy. Over the past four years, I have worked in Malawi, Argentina, and Tanzania on solar PV projects working extensively with rural communities.
The conception of this project though, goes back six years, when I was employed by the Belgian ngo APOPO in Morogoro, Tanzania. During the two years I lived there, I got to appreciate the splendour of the Uluguru mountains and made a special friendship with Saidi, gardener at APOPO, who lived in Choma village in the mountains. Saidi and I came up with the idea of a community based tourism initiative in Choma. Because my employment with APOPO ended and we did not have the necessary resources at the time, we couldn’t implement it but we stayed in contact over the past years and kept dreaming about our touristic project.
Now, 6 years later, I am working in Tanzania again and the time is right to make it happen! This project is a personal initiative that I am doing on a voluntary basis, besides my professional activities.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:56.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Self employed consultant in Belgium

This is done in four ways.

1) Organizing Barza's. 
Meetings and discussions between former combatants and youngsters from the community. The idea is that these two groups get to know and respect each other. The Barza's are held every Sunday on four different locations.

2) Solidarity Groups.
Perex-CV gives former combatants the opportunity to learn a profession of their choice. Examples are hair dresser, farmer, or carpenter. The participants take part in solidarity groups. consisting of former combatants as well as other youngsters who learn to perform the same profession. The goal of these groups is to help each other financially and with everyday issues. After the education, when they practice their jobs, they keep on taking part in the solidarity groups.

3) Reunification of former combatants with family.
After leaving the army, former combatants face the risk of exclusion by their family. They might not understand why they joined the army and might not like their current behavior. Perex-CV mediates between the participants and their families, so they will be accepted again.

4) School peace clubs at secondary schools.
In order to create awareness about peace, human rights, create a mutual understanding between tribes, and between former combatants and community members, and to fight stereotypes, Perex-CV gives peace education at secondary schools.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:40.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO","birtenelen@hotmail.com","Triodos Bank","784877130","","","Perex-CV","Zeist","Netherlands","1448","2012-04-12","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Mission of the organization

Our mission is to initiate community driven sustainable development among the pastoralist communities in Samburu District, alleviate poverty and enable them to overcome their problems with dignity.
Organisation background
Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) is a Non Governmental Organization whose major focus is to address poverty and other development needs of the Pastoralist communities in Samburu District. 
Formed and registered in the year 2000, Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) employs a comprehensive community based approach where community led initiatives is the basis of our projects and activities. 
Over the years, in partnership with the community and local and international donors, SIP has had a meaningful contribution to improved standards of living lifestyles for the pastoralist households in Samburu District through humanitarian aid, micro enterprise development, community training and education support.
IN support education SIP assisted the Waso Rongai community to put up six class rooms and a dormitory and therefore enable their children to go to school. This was an initiative where the strong community ownership was utilized to realize maximum community contribution and participation. The same school was assisted to improve its school feeding Programme through a dairy goat project that was supported by MRDF(Methodist Relief Development Funds). Six women groups have received technical and financial support from SIP through training on entrepreneurial skills and provision of small grants and revolving loans. 

Our latest support to the community through funding from MRDF(Methodist Relief Development Funds) has ensured the communities engage in and adopt beekeeping as a source of livelihood having trained 80 beekeepers and supply of 120 beehives both in Ndoto and Nyiro locations.

HIV/AIDS has become a reality in Samburu District and SIP came up with a strategy to reach the Moran’s who are the sexually active group by distributing condoms through young men we termed as informed friends. The project also intervened during the mass circumcision and ensured that transmission of HIV/AIDS is not propagated by use of one knife for the boys.

In the overall SIP aims to achieve the following objectives.
1.	Develop alternative means of earning a living parallel to nomadic pastoralist as a way of protecting livelihoods from the effects of drought and poverty.

2.	Protect and preserve the cultural heritage of the Samburu people e.g. Wildlife, forests, culture, and other natural resources.

3.	Promote the development of markets for livestock and livestock products. 

4.	To enhance and improve access to preventive and curative health services by supporting and stocking health facilities in the most underserved areas of Samburu District. 

        Governance
SIP works in collaboration with local government authorities to best define the needs in the community and as all the staff and Board members are from the region, they are well placed to identify the needs of the communities in which they work. The Board is composed of 4 men and 1 woman, who are all from the 3 areas in which SIP operates. Some Board members still live in Samburu, but others ar","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:47:30.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO

Graag wil ik voor deze vrouwen echte huisjes laten bouwen, waar ze met de weeskinderen samen ( net als in de dorpen in afrika) kunnen gaan wonen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:15.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting in oprichting","mhtalsma@gmail.com","Rabo","149181329","","","stichting Marijke`s hoop","lavendelheide","None","149","2008-12-21","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Zij heeft gewerkt in het weeshuis Missahoe Children's Home. 

Dit weeshuis heeft noodzakelijk een nieuw onderkomen nodig! Er is al begonnen met de bouw, d.w.z. dat de fundering er ligt. Helaas zijn de middelen niet toereikend en kan er op dit moment niet meer verder worden gegaan met de bouw. Als de bouw van het weeshuis zijn doorgang kan vinden, betekent dat het Missahoe Children’s Home onderdak kan bieden aan 200 weeskinderen. Op dit moment wonen er 37 kinderen in de oude veel te kleine locatie. 

Met een kapitaalinjectie van €5.000,- ten bate van aanschaf van kozijnen en ramen, hopen we de bouw nieuw leven in te blazen. Hopelijk kan het weeshuis dan snel afgebouwd worden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:34.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","27328908","info@stichtingmissahoe-wonder.nl","","104200006","","","Stichting Missahoe Wonder","","None","246","2009-07-11","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Leo van Iersel werkt met Cecil Kids sinds 2009 en heeft sindsdien geholpen met het aansluiten van de school op elektriciteit, het beginnen van computerlessen, beginnen van een winkel en het verkopen van zelfgemaakte kaarten om inkomen te genereren, aanschaf van stoelen, tafels, uniformen en boeken, en het helpen van weduwen om geld te verdienen door bijvoorbeeld het verkopen van brandhout, repareren van kleding, riet weven voor dakbedekking, groentenstalletjes, etc.

Cecil Kids was established by Anne Wambua eight years ago in Bombolulu, a slum of Mombasa, Kenya. Cecil Kids has a nursery school in order to give quality education to the children of this neighbourhood, runs small-scale income-generating projects with widows and single mothers, and has a youth group which educates the people of their community about HIV-prevention, alcohol- and drug abbuse, and the importance of education.

Leo van Iersel has worked with Cecil Kids since 2009 and has helped to bring electricity to the school, to start computer lessons, a shop and selling postcards, to collect money to buy chairs, tables, uniforms and books, and to help widows to start a small business for example by selling firewood, repairing clothes, weaving thatch for roofing, vegetable stalls, etc.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:00.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Self-help group/project","info@cecilkids.org","Barclays","0164535800","","BARCKENX","Cecil Kids","Nkuruma Road","Kenya","1308","2011-12-20","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

In 2004 verbleven Marieke de Wild en Luuk Eickmans (de oprichters van Cycling out of Poverty) 6 maanden in Oeganda, waar ze samenwerken met een organisatie (FABIO) die fietsen uitgeeft op microkrediet. Ze deden een onderzoek  naar de impact die een fiets heeft op de levenssituatie van arme vrouwen en hun gezinnen. De resultaten waren indrukwekkend en bij terugkomst in Nederland liet het hen niet los. Onder de naam Cycling out of poverty starten ze kleinschalige inzamelingsacties om de organisatie FABIO in Oeganda, en twee pratnerorganisaties in Ghana en Burkina Faso te ondersteunen. Wilde Ganzen en ontwikkelingsorganisatie NCDO ondersteunen deze actie financieël. Begin 2007 wordt Cycling out of poverty een officiële stichting en in hetzelfde jaar wordt de actie van Cycling out of poverty uitgeroepen tot beste actie/voorlichting van 2007. In 2008 is het aantal afrikaanse partners / - projectlanden toegenomen van 3 naar 7 landen (Oeganda, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Togo, Kenia, Rwanda en Malawi). 

De Afrikaanse partners voeren de fietsprojecten uit: van aanvraag tot monitoring en evaluatie. Cycling out of poverty is de organisatie die hen hierin ondersteunt door fondsen te werven in Nederland en de capaciteitsopbouw verzorgt voor de Afrikaanse partners en partnerschappen zoekt zodat de projecten duurzaam uitgevoerd kunnen worden. Zo komen met financiële steun van I-CE (Interface for Cycling Expertise) onze Afrikaanse partners jaarlijks samen om van elkaar te leren en getraind te worden.

Inmiddels hebben de Afrikaanse partnerorganisaties van Cycling out of poverty meer dan 1000 fietsen uitgegeven op afbetaling. De doelgroep varieert van kleinschalige boerinnen op het platteland (zoals een eerder project hier op 1%CLUB: Zie Ghana) in Afrika tot scholieren en van enterpreneurs tot gezondheidszorg medewerkers (zoals een eerder project hier op 1%CLUB: zie fietsambulances in Oeganda).

In dit project werken we samen met onze oudste partner FABIO waarmee we al fietsen op microkrediet hebben verstrekt in voormalig oorlogsgebied en op het platteland even ten noorden van Jinja. Zij gaven ook met steun van Cycling out of poverty de fietsambulances uit en deden een pilot project fiets-naar-school van waaruit dit fiets-naar-school project is ontstaan.

Wars which kill innocent people, Genocide and its ideology and the ignorance of human rights have become major challenges in the world, also in the African Great Lakes region.

The community is a 3500 peoples.MRDF(methodist relief funds),SIP colloborate with ministry of livestock in buying of animals,vet drugs and giving good management of camels.the three area where the board mebers hail from is waso rongai,latakenye and sereriti.

Mission of the organization

Our mission is to initiate community driven sustainable development among the pastoralist communities in Samburu District, alleviate poverty and enable them to overcome their problems with dignity.
Organisation background
Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) is a Non Governmental Organization whose major focus is to address poverty and other development needs of the Pastoralist communities in Samburu District. 
Formed and registered in the year 2000, Samburu Integrated Programme (SIP) employs a comprehensive community based approach where community led initiatives is the basis of our projects and activities. 
Over the years, in partnership with the community and local and international donors, SIP has had a meaningful contribution to improved standards of living lifestyles for the pastoralist households in Samburu District through humanitarian aid, micro enterprise development, community training and education support.
IN support education SIP assisted the Waso Rongai community to put up six class rooms and a dormitory and therefore enable their children to go to school. This was an initiative where the strong community ownership was utilized to realize maximum community contribution and participation. The same school was assisted to improve its school feeding Programme through a dairy goat project that was supported by MRDF(Methodist Relief Development Funds). Six women groups have received technical and financial support from SIP through training on entrepreneurial skills and provision of small grants and revolving loans. 

Our latest support to the community through funding from MRDF(Methodist Relief Development Funds) has ensured the communities engage in and adopt beekeeping as a source of livelihood having trained 80 beekeepers and supply of 120 beehives both in Ndoto and Nyiro locations.

HIV/AIDS has become a reality in Samburu District and SIP came up with a strategy to reach the Moran’s who are the sexually active group by distributing condoms through young men we termed as informed friends. The project also intervened during the mass circumcision and ensured that transmission of HIV/AIDS is not propagated by use of one knife for the boys.

In the overall SIP aims to achieve the following objectives.
1.	Develop alternative means of earning a living parallel to nomadic pastoralist as a way of protecting livelihoods from the effects of drought and poverty.

2.	Protect and preserve the cultural heritage of the Samburu people e.g. Wildlife, forests, culture, and other natural resources.

3.	Promote the development of markets for livestock and livestock products. 

4.	To enhance and improve access to preventive and curative health services by supporting and stocking health facilities in the most underserved areas of Samburu District. 

        Governance
SIP works in collaboration with local government authorities to best define the needs in the community and as all the staff and Board members are from the region, they are well placed to identify the needs of the communities in which they work. The Board is composed of 4 men and 1 woman, who are all from the 3 areas in which SIP operates. Some Board members still live in Samburu, but others are based in Nairobi, however they keep in communication, hold regular meetings and can be called upon at any time.
NB. At present we do not have a website due to limited resources but we have contacted someone to help us work on a blog. We will advise the 1%CLUB members as this happens.

Het initiatief is ontstaan toen Nelle Kooren vrijwilligerswerk ging doen in een kindertehuis van de Indiase organisatie Sevai Society. Er bleek nog veel hulp nodig te zijn voor de projecten van de Sevai Society. De Stichting Onderwijs voor India streeft ernaar om samen met deze partnerorganisatie kansarme kinderen in India niet alleen basisonderwijs maar ook middelbaar en hoger onderwijs te bieden.
Inmiddels gaan 7 meisjes al bijna 2 jaar op kosten van de Stichting Onderwijs voor India naar de middelbare school. Deze kinderen wonen bij hun ouders en worden regelmatig bezocht door de vrijwilligers van de Sevai Society. In april 2009 ronden zij hun middelbare school af en hopen wij hen een vervolgopleiding te kunnen bieden.
Daarbij wordt gebruik gemaakt van de onderwijsvoorzieningen die er al zijn in Tamil Nadu. De kinderen kunnen dus op verschillende plaatsen op verschillende instellingen terecht komen. Afhankelijk van de kosten, het niveau van de kinderen en de bereikbaarheid zullen hierin keuzes gemaakt worden. 
De Stichting Onderwijs voor India wordt bestuurd door drie studenten. Daarnaast zijn er een aantal vrijwilligers betrokken bij de Stichting. Wij geven vrijwilligers en andere geïnteresseerden regelmatig de gelegenheid om aan te schuiven in de vergadering.

In dit project sparen we voor materiaal voor de Mary Matha school in Trichy. De school is geeft zowel basis- als middelbaar onderwijs (dit is gewoonlijk in India).","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","stichting

Sinds de oprichters Birma moesten ontvluchten, hebben ze samen met velen anderen hun activiteiten vooral in Thailand voortgezet. The Best Friend richt scholen en bibliotheken op en helpt Birmese vluchtelingen in Thailand. Dit alles vanuit de overtuiging dat onderwijs DE manier is om armoede wereldwijd uit te bannen.

De slogan van de stichting is dan ook: “Geven om en geven aan kinderen in Oeganda”

De stichting zet zich in voor kinderen in Oeganda ongeacht afkomst of religie. De bedoeling is niet alleen om ""vissen te vangen vóór deze arme kinderen, maar ze materiaal te geven om zélf te leren vissen!""

De stichting werkt uitsluitend met vrijwilligers, mensen die zich in hun vrije tijd op enthousiaste wijze inzetten om de gestelde doelen te verwezenlijken. Op deze wijze wordt op een verantwoorde wijze omgegaan met de verkregen sponsorgelden en wordt een maximaal rendement bereikt. Momenteel bestaat onze stichting in Nederland uit 11 leden en komen wij 3-wekelijks bij elkaar voor een vergadering.

In Februari 2004 is onze stichting opgericht door voorzitter Cor van der Neut. Cor was vanwege het 125-jarig bestaan van het schoolbestuur waar hij voor werkt
naar Oeganda gestuurd om een film te maken over Onderwijs in Oeganda. Terug in Nederland besloot Cor dat hij meer met zijn ervaringen moest doen dan alleen een film
maken en zijn verhaal op school te vertellen. Hij besloot de stichting ""Kinderen van Oeganda"" op te richten. Deze naam bleek echter al in gebruik en zo werd de stichting omgedoopt tot Uganda Child Care Foundation. Het eerste project van de stichting was het naar Nederland halen van het weeskinderkoor ""Mwangaza"" van een lokale partner (ARM) die Cor in Oeganda had ontmoet.


In 2004 kwam dit weeskinderkoor naar Nederland. De komst van dit koor werd betaald van het vakantiegeld van de leden van de stichting.
Na 4 weken touren in Dordrecht e.o had het kinderkoor genoeg geld opgehaald om een kleuterschool in een buitenwijk te bouwen en te starten.

in 2007 heeft dit koor 4 weken in Dordrecht e.o en 2 weken in de Achterhoek opgetreden. Resultaat van deze tour was 120 kinderen gesponsord,een school in Ggaba en een motorfiets voor een sociaal werker.

Momenteel zijn wij druk bezig met een tour te organiseren die plaats zal gaan vinden in sept/okt 2010 en waar Mwangaza Dordrecht,de Achterhoek en Zuid-limburg zal gaan aandoen.

In Oeganda werken wij samen met 2 lokale parters:
- Africa Renewal Ministries (ARM)
- Celebrate Hope Ministries (CHM)

De rolverdeling tussen het UCCF tov deze Oegandeese partners is als volgt:
-Het UCCF werft fondsen.
-Gezamelijk worden projecten/programma's bedacht en ontwikkeld ,de wens van de lokale partner is hierbij zeer belangrijk.
-De lokale partners voeren het project.
-De lokale partner brengt verslagen over de projecten uit aan het UCCF.
-De lokale partner beheert het project na afronding
-De UCCF adviseerd de lokale partner waar nodig bij het beheren van het project.

Inmiddels hebben wij al een aantal projecten als stichting weten af te ronden. waar wij als stichting ook erg trots op zijn.

Afgeronde projecten samen met Africa Renewal Ministries:
-opbouwen en starten van een kleuterschool in een buitenwijk van Kampala
-het bouwen van een keuken bij deze kleuterschool
-het inrichten van een nieuw ziekenhuis in GGaba een dorpje buiten Kampala
-het sturen van 2 containers met educatief materiaal naar Oeganda.
-Bouw van een basischool in het dorp Kakuuto wat ligt in de AIDSprovincie van Oeganda Rakai
-Bouw van een school voor voortgezet onderwijs in Kakuuto.

Stichting Anbu Illam Nederland is in 2007 opgericht door zeven enthousiaste jonge mensen. Zes daarvan hebben voor langere tijd gewerkt met straatkinderen in Chennai, bij de organisatie Anbu Illam, en wilden na terugkomst in Nederland vanuit hier blijven helpen. Tijdens ons verblijf in Chennai hebben we gezien dat straatkinderen bij Anbu Illam niet alleen een veilige en zorgzame thuis hebben, ook worden ze erg gestimuleerd om naar school te gaan. Wij hebben zelf les gegeven aan de kinderen die niet naar een formele school konden en les kregen op het project. Daarnaast hebben we vooral veel leuke activiteiten georganiseerd voor de kinderen, om ze even te laten vergeten wat ze hebben meegemaakt. Ook hebben we ontdekt wat de redenen zijn dat kinderen op straat belanden, door mee te lopen met de staff die dagelijks een aantal dakloze kinderen vindt bijvoorbeeld op het station van Chennai. Het heeft veel indruk gemaakt op ons hoe de organisatie Anbu Illam werkt. Daarom zijn wij sinds eind 2007
een support stichting begonnen. Tot nu toe hebben we met behulp van
particulieren, bedrijven, scholen en fondsen al heel wat mooie projecten
kunnen realiseren. Bijvoorbeeld een bibliotheek, een verdieping op het weeshuis voor meisjes, een waterzuiveringsinstallatie en een auto om in noodsituaties kinderen op te pikken. We vinden het belangrijk dat ook mensen in Nederland aandacht hebben voor het probleem.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:38:54.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","De stichting is ingeschreven bij de Kamer van Koophandel te Utrecht onder nummer 30.23.27.30","info@anbuillam.nl","","140999736","","","Anbu Illam Nederland","","None","202","2009-06-26","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Astrid overleed op 11 juli 2008 aan de gevolgen van het zogenaamde Marburgvirus dat zij in Oeganda opliep tijdens een bezoek aan de Python Cave (vleermuizengrot) in Maramagambo. Astrid was de eerste toerist ooit die met dit virus uit Afrika is teruggekomen. Het is een virus uit de Ebola familie waartegen nog geen medicijnen bestaan en dat in veel gevallen een dodelijke afloop heeft. De kans om het op te lopen is zéér gering. Tot juni 2008 zijn gedurende meer dan 10 jaar dagelijks toeristen op bezoek geweest in de grot zonder dat zich ooit een besmetting heeft voorgedaan. De grot is inmiddels niet meer toegankelijk voor toeristen. 


Enkele dagen voor het bezoek aan deze grot bezocht Astrid een school in de plaats Bwera (Kasese district), aan de grens met Congo. Op deze school worden voornamelijk weeskinderen opgevangen. Deze kinderen leiden een moeilijk bestaan. Ze wonen vaak ver weg, bij familie of leiden een zwervend bestaan en slapen dan op school. De school bestaat uit 8 lokalen, met slechts gaten als ramen of deuren. De lokalen zijn veel te klein voor de gemiddeld 45 kinderen die er les krijgen, zodat ze met hun boek of schrift op schoot moeten zitten tijdens de lessen. Allerlei voorzieningen die wij vanzelfsprekend vinden, ontbreken deels of helemaal. Er zijn nauwelijks sanitaire voorzieningen, er is geen elektriciteit, nauwelijks lesmateriaal en er zijn geen speeltoestellen. Doordat de kinderen geen thuis hebben of in zeer armoedige omstandigheden leven, moet de school ook voor eten en schooluniformen (verplicht in Oeganda) zorgen.

                   

Astrid heeft zich het lot van deze kinderen erg aangetrokken en had de intentie om zich bij terugkomst hiervoor in te gaan zetten. Door haar zeer plotselinge en tragische overlijden is zij hier niet meer aan toegekomen. Haar echtgenoot Jaap Taal     heeft daarom het initiatief genomen om ter nagedachtenis aan Astrid en de wensen die zij had, een stichting op te richten. Op 14 november 2008 was de Astrid Uganda Foundation een feit.    

Het is de doelstelling van de stichting om in eerste instantie de Green Valley Nursery and Orphanage Centre School in Bwera te steunen. Indien de financiële middelen het toelaten zullen in een later stadium ook andere, soortgelijke activiteiten opgestart worden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Kvk 17236765","info@astridugandafoundation.com","Rabo","147353009","NL29RABO0147353009","","Astrid Uganda Foundation","Gemert","Netherlands","268","2009-09-17","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Founded in 2000 with the advent of a digital design school for youth from the informal settlements, called Nairobits. 10 years later NairoBits is a fully fledged institute and Butterfly Works has gone on to utilize all she learnt from that amazing start up, to further develop her own methods of co-creation, design products and media programs which contribute to the greater good of people and planet. 

The work at Butterfly Works can safely be called eclectic in its range from consumer social product design and distribution to the development of digital and mobile educational materials and learning environments. 

We are currently working with 14 employees in the Amsterdam office, plus 3 freelancers and two volunteers who support us occasionally / on certain projects. 
Our team is a micture of designers, strategists and researchers.

We do not have fixed field stuff but are frequently travelling ourselves in order to hold our co-creation workshops and concept development workshops with partner organisations in the field.
We base all our work on this participatory approach which means that we develop all our projects and project contentes in close cooperation with our partners and people of the target group. Content and relevance of topics etc. are identified by them and determined together with them.

Yet there is a common thread in all these works, in their innovative nature, their adherence to quality, their respect for everyone in the chain of events involved and possibly most importantly the centrality of the end user in the design process.

Butterfly Works invents, designs, and implements social events and so doing connects people, businesses and organisations always building a positive chain of events. Butterfly Works initiates projects and provides sustainable answers to international social issues.

In short Butterfly Works is an inspirational creation company with partners and clients all over the world that are intertwined with a deeply rooted sense of global justice. If it is still not clear, please look at our programs and projects as it all becomes clear in the practice You can follow us on twitter @butterflyworks or via our blog @ butterflyworks.wordpress.com","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:51.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

De Female Cancer Foundation (FCF) vecht met behulp van onderwijs, onderzoek en innovatieve, praktische technieken wereldwijd tegen baarmoederhalskanker. Baarmoederhalskanker wordt veroorzaakt door een seksueel overdraagbaar virus HPV en is daardoor goed te voorkomen.

It was officially registered as a CBO in 2008 and in 2009, the process to register the organization as NGO will be completed.
Hope Alive Uganda was formed to support orphans and needy children, because it found that 75 % of the children are unable to go to school.  These children are most of the time unable to go to school due to the death of their parents or guardians who have left them without means of survival.   Most of them have died of HIV/AIDS.
Hope Alive Uganda registered 300 orphans and needy children and tries to provide them with necessary assistance. The percentage of girls is higher than boys.  Its first objective is to support the orphans and needy children so that they can get an education and to find ways and means to meet their spiritual, physical and social needs.  It also seeks to address the problems of girls in order to see that girls are getting the same opportunities as boys.    Hope Alive Uganda tries to work hand in hand with other organizations to achieve its goals.

10 people work for HAU within the organization.  Several volunteers work for the several projects we are running.  We have volunteers from the World school in the Netherlands working on a hiv/aids & malaria task, we have  a volunteer working on the ground who is the team leader of hiv/aids counseling, we have volunteers in the Netherlands working on tasks through the 1 % club, we have volunteers working on tasks through Nabuur.

We run several projects:
•	goats project (in total, 38 orphans have received a goat.  The idea behind this is that the orphans can breed the goats and can earn money to sustain themselves and pay school fees, school uniforms, school materials, daily needs etc.  The first female offspring is handed back to HAU which will then be passed on to another orphan.  In this way, the project can continue.  HAU monitors the project).
•	School project.  HAU plans to build a primary school for the orphans and needy children.
•	Chicken project.  The chicken project will start early 2010.   It is an income generating project.
•	Glasses project.  Eye clarify, Hans Anders and CZ have donated about 1600 pairs of glasses in total and enabled HAU to set up an ‘eyecamp’ to provide the community with free pairs of glasses.
•	A project to empower women  this project will start in 2010.

Hope Alive Uganda was founded in 2008 in Kisozi, Kamuli district.   There are many orphans in Kisozi, Hope Alive Uganda has registered more than 300 orphans, but the number is even bigger than this.  Many orphans have lost their parents because of AIDS.  Many orphans are looked after by guardians or other members in the community in Kisozi.   Hope Alive Uganda decided to focus on this group as the children are the most vulnerable group in Kisozi, but also the group for whom we can create a better future.  We have 1 Ugandan volunteer in Kisozi and we are planning to cooperate with two dutch organizations to send dutch volunteers to us from April 2010 on.  The two dutch organisations HAU will be working with for the volunteers are: Horizon Holland Foundation and Different Africa Connection.In the Netherlands, we have volunteers working for Hope Alive Uganda to develop educational materials, to help with fundraising etc.  Hope Alive Uganda operates in the Kamuli district solely.  Nabuur is an online volunteering platform.  We can put tasks on that website we need help with and people can respond to it and help us with that task (for instance if one needs help with a brochure or the website, one can puts a request for help on that website). The project on empowering women has started; we have started with a crafts project.  Women are making necklaces and those are sold in the Netherlands where we have created a small market with shops, hairdressers and museum selling the women’s’ necklaces.  Profits are given back 100 %.    As far as the goats projects is concerned:  we run this goats project to support orphans with school fees, school uniforms and school materials.  The director in Uganda is responsible for monitoring and regularly checks and instructs the orphans (each month).  Members of Hope Alive assist in monitoring this project.  The chicken has started in the sense that accommodation for the chicken are ready, materials are bought and 600 chicken have been ordered.  At the end of February those chicken will arrive.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:17.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered as CBO    CD/2482","info@hopealiveuganda.org","Stanbic Bank","0140013563101","","SBICUGKX","Hope Alive Uganda","Main street","Uganda","400","2010-03-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Sinds 1974 hebben zij, mede geholpen door hun kerk in Brisbane, overal in de wereld mensen en organisaties geholpen en ondersteund die een verandering in het leven van mensen teweeg wilden brengen. Sinds 1980 hebben zij zich gericht op Thailand. Elk jaar gaven zij lezingen voor Thaise pastors. Door wat ze daar van mee kregen, wilden zij iets  doen voor de achtergestelde kinderen van Thailand. In 1986 hebben zij Mercy International (MI) (www.mercy-international.com) opgericht met behulp van hun kerk. Het enige oogmerk van Mercy International is om achtergestelde kinderen te helpen het hoogst bereikbare in hun leven te bereiken.

Mercy International Australië heeft in Thailand in 2000 The House Of Mercy Foundation (HOMF) opgericht om te voldoen aan de wettelijke voorschriften in Thailand. Hoewel de Australische en Thaise organisatie twee gescheiden wettelijke identiteiten zijn, zijn zij verbonden in hun pogingen een toenemend aantal arme en achtergestelde kinderen te helpen hun hoogst bereikbare doel in het leven te bereiken. In Thailand is The House of Mercy een gerespecteerde stichting (registratienummer T 337-2543, registratie adres 486/24 Ratburana Rd, Bangtakok Ratvurana, Bangkok, Thailand 10140).

Mercy International Australië beheert in Thailand momenteel 3 kinderopvanghuizen waarin circa 150 kinderen worden opgevanen. Circa 40 kinderen worden apart opgevangen en verzorgd omdat zij geïnfecteerd zijn met hiv/aids. Als Mercy International Zoetermeer ondersteunen we hen van harte. We hebben al acht jaar contact met hen en zien telkens vooruitgang die geboekt wordt bij de opvang van de kinderen.

Mercy International Zoetermeer bestaat uit een wisselend aantal mensen die hoofdzakelijk in Zoetermeer wonen en zich door het werk van MI Australië voelen aangesproken. Zij willen iets doen voor anderen die het stukken slechter hebben. Momenteel bestaat de groep uit zo’n kleine 10 vrijwilligers van diverse pluimage en we proberen sinds 2005 op zoveel mogelijk manieren geld bij elkaar te vergaren om Mercy International Australië in haar werk te ondersteunen. 
Resultaten tot nu toe: In 2006 is € 1668,65 overhandigd aan Rob Dunk de oprichter van Mercy International voor renovatie/vervanging van de huisvesting van de hiv/aids kinderen in Khon Kaen. Bovendien is € 3895,53 overhandigd aan Sharon Dunk de directrice van Ban Meata Children’s Village in Phrae en dat is gebruikt voor de financiering van de wasserij die we in februari 2008 hebben bewonderd. In 2008 hebben we nogmaals geld overgedragen voor renovatie/vervanging van de huisvesting in Khon Kaen aan de directrice Wendy Lewis van Ban Maeta Home for HIV/AIDS Children in Khon Kaen ter grootte van € 23.000,-. De bedragen aan Khon Kaen zullen worden gebruikt voor de financiering van een nieuw te bouwen vestiging in Khon Kaen. De huidige is veel te klein.
De aanleiding tot deze inspanningen is een paar weken vrijwilligerswerk te willen doen. Via internet is men in 2004 op de organisatie Mercy International gestuit en is men daar ook vrijwilligerswerk gaan doen.. Bij een volgend bezoek in 2006 bleek zodanig progressie te zijn geboekt dat we er vol tegenaan zijn gegaan met nogmaals een bezoek in 2008 en een gepland bezoek in 2011.

Elk van de drie kindertehuizen heeft een eigen directie bestaande uit een Australiër (MI) en een Thai (HOMF) op dezelfde stoel (wettelijk voorschrift, niet alleen in Thailand).

Mercy International is de oprichter van deze kinderopvanghuizen en de financier. The House of Mercy Foundation wordt deels betaald door de Thaise overheid en al het overige en de extra’s worden door Mercy International verstrekt.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:16.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Nog geen stichting, maar een groep actieve mensen.","annette.doorn@casema.nl","","P4982602","","","Mercy International Zoetermeer","","None","317","2009-11-07","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De organisatie heeft als doel jongeren in Freetown, de hoofdstad van Sierra Leone te helpen een eigen inkomen te genereren. Dit gebeurt door middel van verschillende projecten gericht op praktijkonderwijs (vocational, life-skills training) of door jongeren te ondersteunen in het opzetten van een eigen bedrijfje.Vorig jaar heb ik 3 maanden afstudeeronderzoek gedaan in Sierra Leone en ondervonden hoe moeilijk het is voor jongeren in Siera Leone om een toekomst op te bouwen in hun eigen land. (Jeugd)werkloosheid is een van de grootste problemen in Sierra Leone en heeft tot gevolg dat er veel armoede en onvrede is onder jongeren en hun families. Door jongeren de kennis en middelen te geven om een eigen inkomen te verdienen help je niet alleen de jongeren, maar ook hun families, de gemeenschap en draag je bij aan een stabiele toekomst voor Sierra Leone.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:15.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","x","renske.oosterwijk@gmail.com","x","427608139","","","Aw di Bodi","x","Netherlands","1215","2011-10-26","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

De organisatie bevindt zich in het oosten van Oeganda, in de stad Jinja. in de wijk Napier.
In Oeganda worden mensen met een beperking niet als volwaardig gezien. Ze worden weggestopt en er zijn nauwelijks kansen voor ze om zich te ontwikkelen. 

BEHOD is in 2003 door Paul Bulenzi samen met zijn gehandicapte vriend Joseph opgericht, samen startte zij een opvanghuis. Het hoofddoel van BEHOD is mensen met een beperking een opleiding en hiermee vooral kansen bieden en ze uit hun gedwongen isolement halen. 

Op het overheidscomplex wonen momenteel twee groepen mensen met een voornamelijk lichamelijke beperking; volwassenen met een beperking en hun kinderen en studenten. 

Naast het bieden van onderdak en een trainingscentrum heeft BEHOD een aantal nevenactiviteiten. Zo is het terrein in Jinja een inloop waar dagelijks mensen met een beperking en hun families langskomen om elkaar te ontmoeten. Bovendien gaat de staf van BEHOD regelmatig naar de villages om mensen met een beperking te ontmoeten. 

Verder probeert BEHOD het leven van mensen met een beperking te vergemakkelijken door het uitgeven van rolstoelen, brillen en klamboes. Ten slotte organiseert BEHOD jaarlijks een groot sporttoernooi in Jinja voor mensen met een beperking.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:29.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Non Government Organisation","renatesluiseman@gmail.com","ABN AMRO","468037616","","","BEHOD (Beam of hope for the Disadvantaged)","Verzetslaan 20","Netherlands","687","2010-09-05","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

'Geef een kind een toekomst', 'Geef een vrouw een koe’ en een lampenproject. Gegrepen door de armoede in Burkina Faso en vanuit de wens structurele hulp te bieden, met als doel te komen tot zelfvoorziening hebben de 3 bestuursleden van de Stichting (Annemarie Spijer, Diny ter Haar en Eugenie de Jong) meerdere projecten succesvol afgerond. 
De Stichting heeft veel kleinere en grotere donateurs, die bereid zijn donaties te doen ondermeer omdat iedere donatie ten goede komt aan het project dat ze willen steunen en er geen overheadkosten zijn. Reis- en verblijfkosten worden uit eigen middelen betaald. De initiatiefnemers van de Stichting Vrienden van Burkina Faso hebben een galerie, beeldentuin en B&B, met vele bezoekers per jaar, die (bijna) allemaal op de hoogte worden gebracht van de activiteiten van de stichting.
In Ilartenga is een dergelijk project, maar dan met schapen, afgerond. Daar gaan alle kinderen naar school, zijn de vrouwen gealfabetiseerd en is er een waterpomp geslagen en een meelmolen aangeschaft. Het dorp is momenteel onafhankelijk van steun van de Stichting.

Tijdens een verblijf in Bolivia in 2002 zijn de oprichters Hilvert Timmer en Heidi van Hoof in contact gekomen met een lokale Aymara indiaan, die kleine, eenvoudige groentekassen had opgezet op de hoogvlakten van de Andes. Ondanks de mist en de snijdende kou op deze hoogte, blijken enkele uren zon per dag voldoende om groente te doen groeien. Geïnspireerd door dit succes vroegen de dorpelingen aan Hilvert en Heidi of zij hen niet met eenzelfde initiatief zouden kunnen helpen.

Zeven jaar later heeft Chakana vele groentekassen gebouwd in Bolivia. De opzet is altijd hetzelfde gebleven: er wordt alleen gebouwd op aanvraag van, en in samenwerking met de lokale bevolking.

In Nederland heeft Chakana twee mensen (parttime) in dienst. Daarnaast mag de organisatie rekenen op de steun van zo'n 20 actieve, jonge, professionele vrijwilligers.

In 2009 start Chakana ook met groentekassen in Peru, in de dorpen Tiracancha en Patacancha. Hier werkt Chakana samen met stichting HoPe. HoPe is een Nederlandse stichting die volledig bestaat uit vrijwillige krachten. HoPe richt zich met name op onderwijsprojecten in Peru. HoPe heeft in deze dorpen middelbare scholen opgezet met een agrarisch programma en een schoolkas, waarin de scholieren leren hoe zij groente moeten verbouwen.
 
Om de leereffecten van dit agrarisch programma naar de omliggende gemeenschappen te laten uitstralen, gaan HoPe en Chakana in deze gemeenschappen samenwerken en kassen bouwen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Chakana is sinds 2005 geregistreerd als Stichting in de Kamer van Koophandel.

Over 29,000 orphaned and vulnerable children are supported through community initiatives known as Arks throughout South Africa mainly in the rural and impoverished areas. An ark is not restricted to a physical structure, rather it is a network of accountable and synergistic individuals armed with the skills and confidence to care for the OVC.

Noah‟s model is one that starts with an approach by a community to Noah to assist them to care for their OVC. Noah assists in the formation of a committee of community leaders to focus on the children. They are trained in the needs of children and in turn recruit a volunteer group who are trained and then register OVC in their community. Volunteers continually monitor the circumstances of the children and refer them to the appropriate agency as needed. The final pillar of an Ark is a dedicated resource centre from which programmes and services are rolled out.

The children are provided with holistic programmes to ensure that they grow up into confident and whole individuals with bright futures regardless of the circumstances they are born into.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:45:58.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Section 21 Reg.No 2002/021668/08

Stichting Karunia is in januari 2009 opgericht door Jeanette van Oostrum. Indirecte aanleiding is dat zij geboren is op het eiland Sumba in 1965, omdat haar ouders als zendingsarbeiders op het eiland Sumba werkzaam waren. Op vijfjarige leeftijd ging zij met haar ouders naar Nederland .
Van 1992 t/m 2002 heeft zij als reisbegeleidster gewerkt. Ze is altijd erg gericht op de problematiek van de lokale bevolking en in het bijzonder van de kleine Sunda-eilanden. Ook beheerst zij het Indonesisch, waardoor ze goed contact met de lokale bevolking heeft.
De directe aanleiding is dat zij in November 2008 een reis maakte over het eiland Flores, met een bevriende Stichting, en zich daar het lot van de bevolking aantrok. Tijdens deze reis zijn de contacten met het tehuis Panti Alma ontstaan.
 Tijd voor een eigen Stichting om de bevolking, middels adoptie en kleine projecten, te helpen. De Stichting startte in 2009 op het eiland Flores en zal uitgebreid worden op het eiland Sumba.

We realiseren dit door:
- het financieren van de bouw en de exploitatie van het Lord Buddha Home for Children met bijbehorende infrastructuur voor kasteloze weeskinderen. Opvang, basisgezondheidszorg, onderwijs en vakopleidingen staan daarbij centraal.
- kasteloze kinderen en jongeren met een verhoogd risico op ontsporing, daarvan mogelijk te vrijwaren door deze kinderen en hun ouders ondersteuning en advies aan te bieden vanuit het Lord Buddha Home for Children en de daar aanwezige voorzieningen, waar wenselijk en mogelijk, ook voor hen open te stellen.
In onze strategie werken we samen met een betrouwbare partnerorganisatie in India op het vlak van projectidentificatie, projectuitvoering, projectfinaciering ern projectevaluatie. We streven naar resultaten die bekllijven, met als doel gemarginaliseerde bevolkingsgroepen te begeleiden naar onafhankelijkheid. Empowerment en ownership zijn daarbij de centrale thema""s.
Met empowerment bedoeln we dat we de mensen in Bodhgaya en onze samenwerkingspartner hun eigen krachten en talenten laten ontdekken en ontwikkelen. Daarbij onderkennen we dat geld niet altijd het aangewezen middel is om projecten van de grond te krijgen. Het delen van kennis, ervaring en vaardigheden is vaak even belangrijk. Dat doen we onder meer door netwewrken en training.
Met ownership bedoelen we dat de projecten die we ondersteunen, projecten van de mensen zelf zijn en dat ze zelf ook verantwoordelijk zijn voor de voortgang. Om afhankelijkheid te voorkomen blijven we kritisch en dagen we de mensen uit om ondernemend te zijn. Door meer aan de lokale partner en de lokale bevolking over te laten,merken we dat dit voor de projecten eerder goed dan slecht is.
Stichting Kinderhulp Bodhgaya is opgericht door Ine le Blanc. De aanleiding daarvoor was een reis in het voetspoor van de Boeddha, met eindpunt Bodhgaya, de plaats waar volgens overlevering de Boeddha de Verlichting bereikte. Bodhgaya ligt in Bihar, de meest arme deelstaat van India. In Bodhgaya kwam Ine ogen en oren te kort, maar wat haar het meest raakte waren de kinderen van de straat. Ine startte de stichting Kinderhulp Bodhgaya om deze kinderen terug te mogen brengen naar wat ze mogen zijn: Kinderen! Met hulp van de Nederlandse ambassade in Delhi werd een goede betrouwbare partner in India gevonden om het werk ter plekke uit te voeren. In oktober 2005 werd het ""Lord Buddha Home for Children"" geopend. 
In Nederland wordt gewerkt met een onbezoldigd bestuur van 7 personen. Daarnaast zijn er nog een aantal vrijwilligers werkzaam op diverse terreinen zoals ondersteuning secretariaat, communicatie, marketing en advies, website beheer e.d.
Alle donaties die we ontvangen gaan voor 100% naar de projecten van het Lord Buddha Home.
De uitvoering van het project is onderverdeeld in verschillende fasen:Fase I met looptijd 2004-2009 is inmiddels helemaal gerealiseerd en bestond uit:
-aankoop terrein en ommuring daarvan
-bouw en inrichting van een kantoor.

Het plan om een stichting op te richten werd geboren toen de bestuurder (Janny van der Velden) tijdens een van haar reizen door West-Afrika geconfronteerd werd met vele kansarme kinderen en jongeren in Ghana.

Stichting Kumasi heeft de afgelopen 3 jaren goederen verscheept om de arme mensen in de wijk Ekon te geven. Kleding, schoeisel, naaimachines en medische materialen en schoolmaterialen zoals schriften, balpennen, voetballen en kleding en educatief speelgoed. De stichting werkt met twee Nederlandse verpleegkundigen die hun expertise hebben in het werken met vluchtelingen. Het door de GGD Nederland en de Medische Opvang Asielzoekers ontwikkelde project “Wijzer in de Liefde"" hebben zij geïntroduceerd bij de PPAG (één van de partnerorganisaties in Ghana). Dit voorlichtingsprogramma bestaat uit onderwerpen als seksualiteit, hygiëne, soa-hiv-aids, weerbaarheid, geboorteregeling en vriendschap en relaties. De PPAG en de zusterspost in Ekon hebben te weinig vrijwilligers en juicht de hulp van Stichting Kumasi toe voor Ekon, waar onze verpleegkundigen dit project hebben uitgevoerd. Het accent van de projecten ligt op het gebied van de gezondheidszorg en voorlichting. Het bestuur in NL bestaat uit:

    * Joop van der Velden, voorzitter
    * Janny van der Velden penningmeester
    * Marion del Prado, secretaris
    * Diane Waarma, lid

De stichting heeft 2 vertrouwenspersonen in Afrika. Dhr. Iddrisu Sualisu , een graanhandelaar en in Kumasi de weduwe Salamata.De stichting heeft 2 vertrouwenspersonen in Afrika. Dhr. Iddrisu Sualisu , een graanhandelaar en in Kumasi de weduwe Salamata. 
1.      Uitvoerder en vertrouwenspersoon in Ghana Dhr. Iddrissu, Sualisu. Vooral hij is een belangrijke vertrouwenspersoon binnen onze stichting.  Gezien de armoede en de tussenkomst van blanken is een Ghanese vertrouwenspersoon een onmisbare schakel om hoge marges in de uitgaven van materialen en personeel te voorkomen.  
Sinds 2004 werkt de stichting nauw samen met Sualisu. Gebleken dat hij geen cent teveel uitgeeft en een hoog verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel heeft t.a.v van de financiën van de stichting. Hij heeft en wil zelf geen stichting maar geeft 10% van zijn jaarinkomen aan de arme mensen. Hij zorgt dat er meerdere kinderen onderdak en scholing krijgen.
2.    Salamata is een vrouw die 4 weeskinderen onder haar hoede heeft . Zij verzorgt deze kinderen volledig. De stichting steunt haar financieel. Dit is een project dat niets te maken heeft met het project Ekon. Dit speelt zich af in Kumasi, waar het ook begonnen is. 
Het bouwen van de toiletten (waar het bij dit project omgaat) gaat onder de verantwoordelijkheid van Iddrisu Sualisu. Hij heeft veel ervaring met het bouwen van huizen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:50:56.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","ANBI stichting

Omdat ieder kind dezelfde kansen verdient hun droom waar te maken, is eind 2009 Proniños opgericht. Proniños geeft kinderen die kans door in ontwikkelingslanden zoals Peru, Kenia en Ethiopië aanvullende scholing te geven op het gebied van sparen en leren omgaan met geld, het milieu, de wereld en zelfontplooiing. Alles wat voor kinderen hier vaak vanzelfsprekend is, wil Proniños de kinderen daar ook geven zodat zij dezelfde keuzes kunnen maken en zelf een betere toekomst kunnen creëren en hun dromen waar kunnen maken. 

Aanvullende scholing is naast het reguliere onderwijs nodig omdat:
• kinderen in ontwikkelingslanden halve dagen naar school gaan en drie maanden zomervakantie hebben. 
• het onderwijsniveau laag is.
• het belang van onderwijs niet bekend is bij de ouders en de kinderen van onze projecten dat aan ze over kunnen brengen met het doel analfabetisme uit te bannen.
• de wereld steeds kleiner wordt door het internet en televisie waardoor de kinderen weten hoe het in het westen is.
• kinderen de toekomst zijn en zij het verschil kunnen maken.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.

Our aim is to ensure that every child is granted their right to a childhood through long term and sustainable positive behavioural changes.
First Steps Himalaya was set up in 2008 by Founding Directors, Fionna Heiton and Durga Aran who saw a need for support to mothers of babies and young children. Most Nepali babies are underweight and parents unaware of their role in their child’s development. This is an underlying factor in the lack of preparation for school and the subsequent poor results and high drop-out rates. The creation of an early childhood centre could serve the needs of both mothers and babies and pre-school children to break the cycle of poverty by empowering  women to value their child’s education and fight to keep them in school. By doing this the miserable existence of millions of women and girls could become a thing of the past and children would win their right to a childhood.
First Steps Himalaya is administered by Fionna Heiton who is the sole employee. She is aided by a small team of volunteers. In addition, Durga works in a voluntary capacity to supervise all field based work in Nepal both on the ground and from New Zealand. This is further supported by the New Zealand based board of trustees.
Our inaugural project began in February 2009 with phase 1 allowing the creation of the early childhood centre in Sangachok, Nepal.  Classes for the children commenced in July 2009 with 45 children under 5 years which then moved into a purpose built centre in October 2009. Within such a short time frame of just three months, there have been exceptional results in terms of child development and learning. Toddlers who previously lacked stimulation quickly began crawling, grasping and walking. Pre-school aged children who were developmentally stunted, unable to follow instructions or hop, skip or jump, delighted in following simple instructions and participated in play based learning and active movement, critical to brain development. 
First Steps Himalaya provides the funding and expertise to First Steps Nepal who implements all project work.

Daarom stellen wij ons ten doel het ontwikkelen, stimuleren en ondersteunen van sportgerelateerde (internationale) initiatieven die de verbetering van de sociale positie van minderheden in Afrika dienen te bevorderen. In deze initiatieven draait het niet om sport als prestatiegerichte of enkel  recreatieve activiteit, maar wordt sport juist ingezet als middel om de integratie van marginale groepen zoals gehandicapten, straatkinderen, HIV-geïnfecteerden en vrouwen binnen samenlevingen te bevorderen. Daarnaast  draagt sport zeker ook bij aan het verhogen van de weerbaarheid van deze groepen.

Sport wordt ook gebruikt als instrument en platform voor educatie en voorlichting over de wereldwijde AIDS problematiek, handicaps en de positie van gehandicapten in de samenleving. Deze laatste activiteiten zijn vooral gericht op de totstandbrenging van gedragsverandering bij betrokken doelgroepen ten aanzien van HIV/AIDS en marginale groepen in de samenleving.

Sport 4 Socialisation werkt nauw samen met lokale organisaties in Afrika. Er wordt dan ook veel waarde gehecht aan de duurzaamheid van de projecten die wij onze lokale partners helpen ontwikkelen. Er wordt veel aandacht besteed aan kennisoverdracht en capaciteitsopbouw van de lokale partnerorganisatie. Het uiteindelijke doel is namelijk dat de partner organisatie zelfstandig de projecten kan ontwikkelen, uitvoeren en evalueren.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:21.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Los Cachorros is gespecialiseerd in de opvang van  straatkinderen: veelal verslaafde, getraumatiseerde kinderen die permanent op straat leven. Via straatwerk, opvang, psychosociale zorg, onderwijs en voorlichting begeleiden we deze kinderen van de straat naar een toekomst op eigen benen of re-integratie met familie.

De stichting Los Cachorros is opgericht door Alanya Santa Cruz, van oorsprong Peruaanse en geadopteerd door Nederlandse ouders. Na een 'roots' reis met andere geadopteerden in het jaar 2000, besloot Alanya zich in te zetten van de straatkinderen uit haar geboorteland. Alanya richtte de stichting Los Cachorros op en vestigde zich in haar geboortestad Ayacucho.  
In Nederland houdt een vrijwillig bestuur toezicht op het project. Omdat Stichting Los Cachorros de laatste jaren steeds meer activiteiten heeft ontplooit in Peru, is ook het werk in Nederland toegenomen. Sinds maart 2009 is daarom een Algemeen Coördinator in dienst (part time), die middels fondsenwerving, PR activiteiten en de coördinatie van vrijwilligers voor Nederland en Peru, zorg draagt voor de continuïteit van het project; dit is Lieselotte.
Los Cachorros heeft een Adviesraad en binnenkort tevens een Comité van Aanbeveling.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Rechtspersoon: stichting.

It was officially registered as a CBO in 2008 and in 2009, the process to register the organization as NGO will be completed.
Hope Alive Uganda was formed to support orphans and needy children, because it found that 75 % of the children are unable to go to school.  These children are most of the time unable to go to school due to the death of their parents or guardians who have left them without means of survival.   Most of them have died of HIV/AIDS.
Hope Alive Uganda registered 300 orphans and needy children and tries to provide them with necessary assistance. The percentage of girls is higher than boys.  Its first objective is to support the orphans and needy children so that they can get an education and to find ways and means to meet their spiritual, physical and social needs.  It also seeks to address the problems of girls in order to see that girls are getting the same opportunities as boys.    Hope Alive Uganda tries to work hand in hand with other organizations to achieve its goals.
10 people work for HAU within the organization.  Several volunteers work for the several projects we are running.  We have volunteers from the World school in the Netherlands working on a hiv/aids & malaria task, we have  a volunteer working on the ground who is the team leader of hiv/aids counseling, we have volunteers in the Netherlands working on tasks through the 1 % club, we have volunteers working on tasks through Nabuur.

We run several projects:
•	goats project (in total, 38 orphans have received a goat.  The idea behind this is that the orphans can breed the goats and can earn money to sustain themselves and pay school fees, school uniforms, school materials, daily needs etc.  The first female offspring is handed back to HAU which will then be passed on to another orphan.  In this way, the project can continue.  HAU monitors the project).
•	School project.  HAU plans to build a primary school for the orphans and needy children.
•	Chicken project.  The chicken project will start early 2010.   It is an income generating project.
•	Glasses project.  Eye clarify, Hans Anders and CZ have donated about 1600 pairs of glasses in total and enabled HAU to set up an ‘eyecamp’ to provide the community with free pairs of glasses.
•	A project to empower women  this project will start in 2010.

Hope Alive Uganda was founded in 2008 in Kisozi, Kamuli district.   There are many orphans in Kisozi, Hope Alive Uganda has registered more than 300 orphans, but the number is even bigger than this.  Many orphans have lost their parents because of AIDS.  Many orphans are looked after by guardians or other members in the community in Kisozi.   Hope Alive Uganda decided to focus on this group as the children are the most vulnerable group in Kisozi, but also the group for whom we can create a better future.  We have 1 Ugandan volunteer in Kisozi and we are planning to cooperate with two dutch organizations to send dutch volunteers to us from April 2010 on.  The two dutch organisations HAU will be working with for the volunteers are: Horizon Holland Foundation and Different Africa Connection.In the Netherlands, we have volunteers working for Hope Alive Uganda to develop educational materials, to help with fundraising etc.  Hope Alive Uganda operates in the Kamuli district solely.  Nabuur is an online volunteering platform.  We can put tasks on that website we need help with and people can respond to it and help us with that task (for instance if one needs help with a brochure or the website, one can puts a request for help on that website). The project on empowering women has started; we have started with a crafts project.  Women are making necklaces and those are sold in the Netherlands where we have created a small market with shops, hairdressers and museum selling the women’s’ necklaces.  Profits are given back 100 %.    As far as the goats projects is concerned:  we run this goats project to support orphans with school fees, school uniforms and school materials.  The director in Uganda is responsible for monitoring and regularly checks and instructs the orphans (each month).  Members of Hope Alive assist in monitoring this project.  The chicken has started in the sense that accommodation for the chicken are ready, materials are bought and 600 chicken have been ordered.  At the end of February those chicken will arrive.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:18.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Registered as CBO    CD/2482","info@hopealiveuganda.org","Stanbic Bank","0140013563101","","","Hope Alive Uganda","Jinja main branch Main street","Uganda","404","2010-03-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

We, as a project group, focus on Argentina. Below you can find a summary of our project.

San Antonio de Los Cobres,  an isolated village in a desolate area located in the northern part of Argentina at 4200 meters above sea level. It only counts a population of around 5600 people who suffer from the extreme weather conditions and unsatisfied basic needs.
The mission of this challenge is to focus on the future of the local youth in this particular region and bring the educational level of the high school in San Antonio de Los Cobres to a higher level. The means by which we are planning to succeed, is to introduce certain ICT skills that ought to be used by the teachers in order expand the learning capabilities of the students. We believe that the use of ICT skills and ICT programs will make learning more fun and it will increase the ways to gain and implement knowledge. Moreover it provides tools that will give the students a better chance on the labor market in their field of preference. 
To make it possible for the teachers to implement such ICT aspects in their curriculum we have decided to create a comprehensive 2 months ICT course where the teachers are able to learn, and subsequently implement, everything there is to learn about different and relevant computer programs in order to build a sustainable platform where the obtained computer knowledge can be passed on from teacher to teacher and from student to student. This way we hope to have started a long term project where eventually the digital gap between the youth of San Antonio de los Cobres and the rest of the world will be closed entirely.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:29.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","nvt","heerohoomans@hotmail.com","Banco Galicia y Buenos Aires","1091961383","","GABAARBA","Peace of Minds","Buenos Aires 37","Argentina","1765","2012-12-16","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Na thuiskomst besloot Anne wat terug te gaan doen. Bij toeval (of niet?) arriveerde er kort daarna een brief vanuit de school met het verzoek om te helpen met het bouwen van schoolbanken. Sindsdien ondersteunt Stichting Anne in Afrika de lokale bevolking met de realisatie van goede initiatieven in Tanzania, gericht op het verbeteren van de kwaliteit van leven van kinderen. De geboden ondersteuning bestaat uit concrete materialen, zoals schoolspullen, een generator, of een windmolen die stroom verschaft aan het opvanghuis voor kinderen die in de gevangenis van Arusha worden geboren. 

Stichting Anne in Afrika spaart sinds 2008 voor kinderen die wees zijn geworden omdat hun ouders aan AIDS overleden zijn. Deze kinderen kunnen nu nog naar school op het New Hope Education Centre, een lokale NGO. Maar de klaslokalen van deze school worden gehuurd, en sinds de verdubbeling in huurprijs vorig jaar zijn de lokalen onbetaalbaar geworden. Zonder eigen school zal het New Hope Education Centre ophouden te bestaan, wat letterlijk betekent dat de weeskinderen op straat komen te staan. Daarom is Stichting Anne in Afrika bezig geweest met de aankoop van een stuk grond om een eigen school voor het New Hope Education Centre op te kunnen bouwen. Inmiddels is het New Hope Education Centre de trotse eigenaar van een prachtig stuk grond van 4,5 acre! De komende tijd wordt stukje bij beetje de nieuwe school gebouwd. Het hek rondom het perceel is af. Dit betekent dat er zeggenschap is over de grond en dat tijdens de verdere bouw de bouwmaterialen beter zijn beschermd tegen diefstal. Na het hek volgen de klaslokalen, slaapvertrekken, keuken, groentetuin, etc. Zodra de benodigde fondsen binnen zijn, wordt gestart met de bouw. Uiteindelijk gaat de school plaats bieden aan 280 kinderen. De vorderingen zijn te volgen via www.anneinafrika.info .

Stichting Anne in Afrika maakt een kleine 100 Euro kosten per jaar. Dit zijn kosten voor de Kamer van Koophandel en het hebben van een bankrekening. Eenieder die zich inzet voor Stichting Anne in Afrika doet dit geheel kosteloos en belangeloos. Stichting Anne in Afrika heeft geen strijkstok.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

We willen hen helpen op te groeien tot zelfbewuste volwassenen die in staat zijn problemen te signaleren, daar oplossingen voor te vinden en die toe te passen. In het klein op persoonlijk vlak, maar groter gezien ook in een gemeenschap of het land. Dat vereist creatief denken, samenwerken, organiseren en coördineren en leidinggevende capaciteiten: levensvaardigheden die Fair Penners leren in het proces – net zoals op een krantenredactie – om tot een nieuwsbrief te komen. De nieuwsbrief is daarbij niet het doel, maar het instrument. Wel vormen de nieuwsbrieven op internet een waardevol en wereldwijd forum voor jongeren en kinderen om ervaringen uit te wisselen.

In juni 2008 is Fair Pen Foundation opgericht door Edith Tulp en Hanneke Houkes. Tot die tijd werkten we nauw samen met Sharing Schools om het project inhoud en vorm te geven.
We zijn Stichting Fair Pen begonnen, omdat we geloven in de visie dat we door jongeren te empoweren, hen de mogelijkheid bieden om zelfbewust, weerbaar, uit eigen kracht en vanuit een intrinsieke motivatie, hun kansen en die van hun gemeenschap aanzienlijk  te vergroten.
In Nederland werken, naast het bestuur, 4 mensen actief mee aan de organisatie. Daarnaast hebben we een ICT-medewerker (veelal op vrijwillige basis) een een vormgeefster (eveneens veelal op vrijwillige basis). Ons bestand met vrijwilligers neemt toe.
In het najaar van 2008 hebben we succesvol een pilot afgerond op drie scholen binnen het netwerk van Sharing Schools Uganda (voortgezet onderwijs). In 2009 hebben we een doorstart gehad. Het project is gerealiseerd op 10 scholen, waarvan 8 scholen succesvol verder zijn gegaan. Met de andere twee wordt overlegd. In 2010 komen er 5 scholen in voortgezet onderwijs bij (inmiddels is dat gebeurd). In het basisonderwijs hebben drie scholen deelgenomen, en daar komen er nog 7 bij.
Het eerste gedeelte van het project in Karamoja op 6 scholen in het basisonderwijs, is succesvol verlopen. Wat vooral positief was, is dat lokale coaches het Fair Pen Project op deze scholen geïmplementeerd hebben: een stap richting duurzaamheid!","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

We hebben nu een nieuwe locatie maar de huur is hoger waardoor er meer fondsen nodig zijn om de kinderen een goede leefomgeving te geven. 

In het kindertehuis werken 15 personeelsleden, dit zijn vrouwen/meisjes die voor de kinderen zorgen, eten koken en lesgeven. De leraressen werken momenteel voornamelijk vrijwillig want er is niet genoeg geld voor het project, ze krijgen wel eten en als het nodig is onderdak. Al er genoeg funding is betaalt het project wel salarissen, dit ligt tussen de 70 en 100 dollar per maand voor een gewone functie. 

Er zijn geen andere organisaties betrokken behalve PURE! for kids en KhmerV. KhmerV is het vrijwilligersbureau in Phnom Penh waarmee PURE! for kids samenwerkt als het gaat over de begeleiding en opvang van vrijwilligers.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:52:13.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KvK nummer: 01123206","info@pureforkids.org","","611724111","","","Stichting PURE! for kids","","None","123","2009-01-06","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Dat doen we middels de Lease Koe (Micro Krediet) , verkopen van Tanzaniaans kunst op www.Africaprints.com en door nieuwe initiatieven. In Tanzania hebben we een eigen organisatie ( Farm Friends Tanzania) die er voor zorgt dat de koeien worden uitgezet, de lening wordt terugbetaald en de volgende koeien worden uitgezet. In totaal werken er 5 m/v.

Voor de stoomtrein is in Tanga de stichting Urithi opgericht. Doel van de stichting is om de stoomtrein te ontwikkelen, vermarkten, runnen en onderhouden. Vanuit Nederland wordt het initiatief nu en in de toekomst ondersteunt.

Een van die initiatieven is de stoomtrein Dar < > Tanga.

Door het teruglopen van het bezoek van de koopkrachtige Amerikanen aan Tanzania en de voorkeur van de Europeanen voor het gebied rond de Kilimanjaro, plukt de kuststreek steeds minder vruchten van de toeristen. Dit heeft met name gevolgen voor de van toeristen afhankelijke sectoren zoals de kunst en de kleinere wildparken aan de kust. 

Het idee is ontstaan om een toeristisch product te ontwikkelen met de stoomtrein van Dar Es Salaam via station Kikoko naar Saadami Nationaal Park. Bij Kikoko is in Bagamoyo de enige (nationale) kunstopleiding van Tanzania. En Saadami Nationaal Park is een nog niet door toeristen ontdekt klein park met eenvoudige authentieke voorzieningen.

Voor het organiseren van de trips, marketing en verkoop is in Tanzania een NGO opgericht cq. Men is verantwoordelijk voor de kwaliteit en de realisatie van het product. Voor het exploiteren van de trein wordt een leasecontract afgesloten met de Tanzaniaanse Spoorwegen. Deze laatste is verantwoordelijk voor het onderhoud en rijvaardig houden van het materieel en personeel.
 
Via de 1% Club willen we geld krijgen voor de opleidingen van de Tanzanianen die de trein moeten gaan vermarkten, runnen en laten rijden.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:50.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting KvK 01094599","maxx@euronet.nl","","308702301","","","Farm Friends Nederland","","None","257","2009-06-09","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

History:-
The foundation stone of Nav Bharat Jagriti Kendra was laid in year 1971, by four engineering graduates who were sensitive to the cause of deprivation of the poverty stricken masses. Highly moved by the condition of the poor villagers in Bihar, trapped in the vicious circle of poverty, they decided to shun their career and plunge into nation building and service to the poor. Deeply influenced by the Great Personalities like Mahatma Gandhi, Binoba Bhave, Lohia, Marx, Lenin and motivated by Jai Prakash Narayan, they initiated social work with a small hamlet of Dalits in Bahera village. They gradually extended in many villages and districts in those 39 years.

The programmes are managed by professionals with pertinent knowledge and experience of rural development as well as by social activists with commitment and dedication.  The project coordinators consult the Programme Advisory Committee as and when required. The organization also promotes capacity building of the project staff on various aspects in order to strengthen the programme. There are also some volunteers in the organization but they are not permanent. The volunteers are both local and international. They support the project generally for 4-5 months and leave.

De stichting is in 2007 opgericht. De aanleiding is dat na 12 jaar burgeroorlog in Sierra Leone weer  mogelijkheden ontstaan. Veel is in de burgeroorlog vernietigd en moet weer opnieuw tot ontwikkeling worden gebracht. De armoede is erg groot, er zijn nog mensen die in de landbouw willen werken, maar ze hebben niet het juiste materiaal en gereedschap om het werk op een professionele manier uit te voeren.
Dhr. Kanu, de oprichter van de stichting NVOFA, was vrijwilliger bij Stichting ""Gered Gereedschap"". Toen deze organisatie een container gereedschap naar Sierra Leone had te vervoeren, is hij meegegaan en zo ontstond het idee om daar het landbouwproject te beginnen.
Momenteel zijn er 3 bestuursleden en hebben we een paar vrijwilligers. De organisatie is nog niet groot, maar indirect zijn er honderden mensen bij dit project betrokken in Sierra Leone. De rol van de stichting  ten opzichte van de organisatie in Sierra Leone is dat wij  ons inzetten voor het welzijn van de bewoners, door de ontwikkeling van de landbouw. Dit wil NVOFA doen door een training te organiseren voor de jongerenorganisatie Nyandenhun Youth Community Development Association (gevestigd in de plaats Newton) en daarna het land van 10 hectare aan hen beschikbaar te stellen voor de productie van rijst. Ze kunnen met dit land de eerder verworven kennis en vaardigheden gebruiken voor het bewerken van het land, het planten van rijst, het onderhoud daarvan en het oogsten en bewaren. Met deze nieuwe interventie wil NVOFA de rijstproductie in Newton stimuleren en de inkomenspositie van de jongerenorganisatie vergroten.

Solotrekkers is opgericht in 2008 door Daan Spits en Jaap van 't Kruis. Samen hebben zij eerder gewerkt aan verschillende projecten in Nicaragua. Het idee om een stichting in Nederland op te zetten was dan ook een logische vervolg stap op hun ervaringen. Daan is een afgestudeerde HBO-er en Jaap werkt al een aantal jaren als documentaire maker voor diverse Nederlandse omroepen. De link om economie en AV (audiovisueel) te koppelen aan OS leek ons een mooie uitdaging! 

Wij geloven in duurzaam ondernemerschap, en dan vooral in ontwikkelingslanden. Lokaal ondernemerschap is dan ook de ""key-word"" van de stichting. Deze kan juist als motor fungeren voor de lokale economie en kan werk-gelegenheid creëren.

In de werkplaats werken 10-12 personen (parttime en fulltime), voornamelijk jongeren die wat extra steun nodig hebben, zoals jongeren met een beperking. Daarnaast zijn er vrijwilligers die de stichting steunen door langdurige inzet of eenmalige klussen, zowel in Nederland als in Suriname.

De stichting bestaat 7 jaar en heeft in die periode een aantal projecten gerealiseerd: 
- opzetten van een succesvolle sociale werkplaats, dankzij bijdrage van het Skanfonds, Microprojecten en de Nederlandse Ambassade te Paramaribo;
- renoveren van schoolmeubilair voor scholen en instellingen;

In concreto voeren we nu een project uit dat betrekking heeft op de opvang, traumaverwerking en educatie van misbruikte en mishandelde kansarme kinderen in de Filippijnen en het bieden van een blijvende verbetering in hun woon- en werksituatie.

We proberen zoveel mogelijk mensen onderdeel te laten worden van onze projecten. Iedereen heeft een bijdrage te leveren. Of het nu financieel is, materieel, door diensten, ondersteuning of de concrete uitvoering van projecten.

De stichting wordt gerund door betrokken en deskundige mensen.  Op de Flippijnen is door ons de stichting Let Us Care Foundation inc. opgericht. De projecten ter plekke worden strategisch gerund door locale staf met Erna Vinkers als projectdirecteur. Op het operationele niveau draaien de projecten al grotendeels zelfstandig. Dit kan doordat we een bekwame en ervaren manager  hebben en doordat alle processen en taken middels een kwaliteitssysteem zijn beheerst en continue worden verbeterd. Dit zorgt voor duidelijkheid in taken en verantwoordelijkheden en rust in huis.

We bewaken een goede uitvoering van de projecten en de besteding van projectgelden door begeleiding en controle ter plekke.

Transparantie en inzichtelijkheid in onze organisatie en financiën is ons uitgangspunt en we waken ervoor dat alle middelen aan het project ten goede komen. Hierdoor zorgen we ervoor dat niets overbodigs aan de zogenaamde “strijkstok” blijft hangen.

Nederlandse of andere buitenlandse vrijwilligers zijn zeer welkom om onze projecten in Nederland of in het projectland ter plekke te ondersteunen. Kijk daarom hoe u ons kunt helpen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:05.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

APOPO is a social enterprise that researches, develops, and deploys detection rat technology for humanitarian purposes. APOPO is a registered charity in Belgium and is headquartered in Tanzania.
APOPO currently employs 123 staff, of which the Majority Tanzanian and Mozambican staff
APOPO's vision is to develop appropriate detection technologies, to empower vulnerable communities. This vision is rooted in a belief that finding local solutions for local problems removes the structural barriers to development.
APOPO's mission is to become the centre of excellence in detection rat technologies, to enhance the impact of life-saving actions.
APOPO utilizes a local resource, the African Giant Pouched Rat (Cricetomys gambianus) for its detection technology. Using these rats as detectors is advantageous due to their efficiency in this role, and their acute sense of smell. Other benefits include their low cost for husbandry & maintenance, ease of transport and their wide availability. It has also been shown that once trained, they can reliably carry out repetitive tasks. Moreover, it is an appropriate tool since it does not depend on high tech equipment or highly skilled labour, increasing its accessibility in the countries of operation.
 APOPO was initiated in response to the global landmine problem. In the mid 1990s it was well recognized that most mine-clearance techniques in use were slow and expensive. The humanitarian community called for an efficient method for the detection of landmines and un-exploded ordnance (UXO) in order to facilitate the repatriation of refugees and distribution of emergency aid, thereby creating the basic conditions for development in a mine-free environment. 
In response to this call an analysis of the landmine problem was made with a special focus on sub-Sahara Africa, which is more affected by landmines than any other region in the world. It became clear that landmines pose a structural barrier to any development. Moreover, vulnerable communities remained dependent on imported expertise to address the complex problems of landmine detection and clearance of suspected areas. 
The idea of using rodents for mine detection was the outcome of a creative process, in which the goal was set to find an appropriate detector sustainable within the African environment, and enabling empowerment of African communities to reduce dependency on foreign aid. Evidence of olfactory discrimination of explosives by lab rats was found in American scientific publications from the 1970s. APOPO found a suitable rodent species in the Giant African Pouched Rat (Cricetomys gambianus), which is omnipresent in sub-Saharan Africa, has a long life span, and is resilient to most tropical diseases. 
APOPO set out to develop an appropriate detection rat technology, based around the Giant African Pouched Rat. The results of a two-year initial research phase strengthened APOPO reasoning to use this species for humanitarian detection tasks in Africa. A group of wild rats were captured and put through a captive breeding program. They were domesticated, and a humane training protocol was developed based on the principles of positive behaviour reinforcement. Once proof of principle was achieved, APOPO transferred the project to Tanzania, to develop the technology together with the African partners in the cultural context the technology would be used in.

History:
1997
The DGOS Belgian Directorate for International Co-operation (DGIS) provided the initial financial support for a feasibility study, which was implemented in a temporary lab in Belgium.
1998
APOPO vzw was registered under the Belgian law as a non-commercial agency. APOPO tried out several breeding methods and training protocols in parallel approaches on different rodent species. One group of laboratory rats was trained to detect explosive samples by pressing levers from within a caged set-up; another group was taught to detect TNT samples hidden in a sandbox. APOPO also started to breed and socialize African Giant Pouched Rats imported from Tanzania and developed potential concepts for the use of these animals in mine-clearance.
2000
Promising results triggered the transfer of APOPO's operational base to Africa. This allowed training and testing of the animals in near-to-real conditions, and further product development in the cultural context. During the first half of 2000, APOPO established its premises and training area at the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA), in Morogoro, Tanzania. The choice of this location was a result of APOPO's collaboration with the Department of Biology of the University of Antwerp (UA), which had a long co-operation with SUA in the field of rodent research. With logistical support from the Tanzanian Peoples Defence Forces (TPDF), APOPO then established extensive training and test minefields. The project maintained its Belgian liaison office at the University of Antwerp.
2001
External evaluation by the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) was performed at the test and training fields at the Sokoine University of Agriculture. The feedback helped to identify areas of growth, and APOPO systematically improved its detection methodology using rats. As a result of the evaluation and efficacy of the programme GICHD also contracted APOPO to conduct research on Remote Explosive Scent Tracing (REST).
2003
APOPO was ready for its first field testing in a real demining scenario, and set up an operation in Mozambique. The first tests on a real mine field showed good results, which were published in the Journal for Mine Action, Issue 9.2 February 2006 (PDF file 200kb).   APOPO won the World Bank Development Marketplace Global Competition, which provided seeding capital for the Tuberculosis research program. (Trained Rats Sniff out TB, Land Mines in Tanzania & Rats Sniff Out TB)
2004
The first group of 11 rats passed official licensing tests according to the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS) under supervision of the Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (GICHD) and the National Institute for Demining in Mozambique (IND). The IND granted APOPO's Mine Detection Rats operational accreditation.   Ceramic artist, Anita Huybens, created 1000 ceramic poppies for display at a historical site in Belgium. This 'klaprozen project' was the start of the most inspiring and successful fundraising campaign for APOPO.
2005
APOPO started the HeroRAT campaign and began building a citizen-based support mechanism through the HeroRAT adoption program.
2006
APOPO started a fully integrated mine-clearance operation in Mozambique, accredited by the National Institute for Demining in Mozambique (IND). This includes manual deminers, Mine Detection Rats and a mechanical capacity for ground preparation.   The Heads of State of the 11 Great Lakes Region Countries (ICGLR) signed a pact for security, stability and development in the region. APOPO was endorsed by the ICGLR as the lead agency and regional capacity for Mine Action in the Great Lakes Region.
2007
APOPO is endorsed by ASHOKA, innovators for the public.   The Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship recognizes APOPO as an outstanding social enterprise, which provides access to the networks of the World Economic Forum.
2008
APOPO Mine Action Program is tasked by the National Institute for Demining in Mozambique (IND) as the sole operators for Gaza province, Mozambique.   APOPO consolidates its strategic plan.   APOPO provides proof of principle to utilize trained rats for the detection of pulmonary TB in human sputum. A poster is presented at the IUATLD conference in Paris, and a manuscript is accepted for publication in the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease.
2009
HRH Princess Astrid of Belgium commits to the honorary presidency of APOPO.   APOPO is awarded the prestigious Skoll Award for social entrepreneurship at the Skoll World Forum in Oxford.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:00.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Vereninging zonder Winstoogmerk en NGO

Hiervoor richt zij een opleidingscentrum voor verloskunde op, waar studenten terecht kunnen voor het specilistische vak verloskunde, dat momenteel in Kenia ontbreekt.
De organisatie is opgericht door vier enthousiaste medici – Reuben Waswa, Julius Maina, Kenneth Ireri en Marianne Darwinkel. Alle vier zijn zij al jaren werkzaam in het medische zorgverlening en het medisch onderwijs . Zij hebben hun krachten gebundeld om  in staat te zijn op een duurzame manier kwalitatief goed medisch onderwijs aan te bieden. Marianne als tropenarts, de andere drie als clinical officer met verschillende vervolgopleidingen. Waswa, Maina en Marianne hebben gemiddeld meer dan 10 jaar ervaring in medisch onderwijs in Kenia op verschillende scholen en aan verschillende faculteiten. Naast training van studenten hebben de drie ook veel aan training van onderwijzers gedaan. Daarnaast hebben zij vele jaren patiëntenzorg verleend en hebben zowel Ireri als Maina een succesvolle medische praktijk aan de Keniase kust. Alle vier de initiatiefnemers zijn betrokken bij de algemene planning en activiteiten van de organisatie. Marianne is de overall manager van de diverse activiteiten, Waswa is actief in de ontwikkeling van de opleidingen en alle andere academische activiteiten, Maina eveneens met de academische activiteiten alsook de bouw. Ireri is betrokken bij alle processen, maar zijn rol zal meer groter worden op het moment dat de gezondheidszorg verlening van start gaat (gedurende het eerste  leerjaar van de eerste groep studenten). 
De organisatie is bezig op eigen locatie de school en het gezondheidscentrum op te bouwen. Daarnaast wordt momenteel hard gewerkt om de opleiding tot clinical officer van de grond te krijgen in samenwerking met een nabijgelegen college. Daarnaast verleent de organisatie op regelmatige basis steun aan het Ministerie van Gezondheidszorg in Tanzania en de overkoepelende organisatie van kerkelijke medische opleidingen in Tanzania om hun praktijk onderwijs te helpen verbeteren.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:40:37.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Ltd. - CPR/2009/5752","info@chpkenya.org","ABN AMRO","566794721","","","Community Health Promotion Kenya - North-Coast Medical Training College","mtwapa","Netherlands","437","2010-03-17","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Lack of employment, death or separation of parents, lack of school fees and other scholastic materials, drug and forms of child abuse have been responsible for the increased number of unemployed and street children.
Founders of the organization discovered that providing the affected and vulnerable children and youth with a means of survival and keeping them busy can help in reducing the impact of this situation on the community.
Members decided to form the organization as a means of reaching vulnerable youth and children who would in turn support the community and the society. The organization has recruited beneficiaries aged 5-25 from the community and surrounding communities but mainly children living on streets. The primary beneficiaries are expected to help themselves, later their siblings, and the community.
In the short time of its existence, the organization has impressed the community as the children who have benefited from its programmes have been seen as useful to the community.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:28.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","CBO 1897","elgonyouthband@gmail.com","Kyewalyanga Fredrick","6002231245","","","Elgon Youth Brass Band Association","Barclays bank of Uganda limited Mbale branch.

In all the projects organised by the FCF, we use a method developed specially for fighting cervical cancer in developing countries: the See & Treat method. The See & Treat method comprises all aspects that are important to combat cervical cancer in developing countries.

Awareness: information about what causes cervical cancer, the risks of cervical cancer and sexual and reproduction-related health aspects.
See & Treat: screening with household vinegar and, if necessary, treatment with cryotherapy.
Training & Education: training of healthcare staff based on the train-the-trainer-principle
Sustainability: sustainable embedding of the See & Treat-concept in the local health centres in the designated areas
The Female Cancer Foundation works with a performance-dependent funding system to promote transparency and efficiency. The funding of each project takes place per activity for which a fixed cost price has been agreed. Payments are thus only made for each woman who has demonstrably been informed, screened and treated. This provides an incentive to work efficiently and to actually realise the intended objectives.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:41:54.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KvK-inschrijfnummer: 34242224, Amsterdam

The goal of the organization is to “give street children and disadvantaged youth in Cambodia a better future. We want to guarantee their right to security, education and health care and protect them from child labour and sexual abuse”. 

To work effectively, we aim our activities at 'Anjali House', a shelter for street children and disadvantaged youth in Siem Reap, Cambodia. By working closely together with Anjali management and staff, we are able to contribute directly to the welfare of the children and evaluate progress at all times.


Friends of Anjali was founded in June 2010, as a result of an inspirational trip and volunteer experiences at Anjali House in the summer of 2009 by its two founders, Remko Vochteloo and Vera Vochteloo-Sanda. The goal of the organization is to “give street children and disadvantaged youth in Cambodia a better future. We want to guarantee their right to security, education and health care and protect them from child labour and sexual abuse”. Through its activities, the organization aims to support the programs at Anjali House, and in particular the arts program and the Young Adult Program.

 

The first operational year saw four specific projects supported. First, photographs of children from Anjali House were sold to Deloitte to add to their art collection and to be exhibited in two of their offices in the Netherlands, and in the headquarters. The monies from this sale were used to support the ongoing photography program at Anjali House.

Second, Friends of Anjali was involved in the water filter project of Anjali House. This project focused on raising money to provide all the families of the children with a water filter, in order to get access to safe and clean drinking water.  Friends of Anjali raised enough money to buy 16 water filters, about 1/3 of the total amount.

Third, Friends of Anjali is actively promoting the ‘Sponsor a Child’ program for Anjali House. In this program, private donors can sponsor an Anjali child for a long term, to ensure the sustainability of the Anjali House programs. At the end of 2010, 14 sponsors are committed to Friends of Anjali.

Fourth, through Richard de Groot, Friends of Anjali was involved in the start and implementation of the Young Adult Program at Anjali House. Friends of Anjali raised enough funds to guarantee to running costs of the 1st year of the Program and provided useful advice and support.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, Kvk nr: 50169637","info@friendsofanjali.nl","ABN AMRO","408907703","NL94ABNA0408907703","ABNANL2A","Friends of Anjali","Luxemburglaan 1","Netherlands","821","2010-12-21","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Net4Kids is in 1999 opgericht door Loek en Anke van den Boog, vanuit een persoonlijke zoektocht naar een concrete manier om minderbedeelde kinderen te steunen. Zij wilden zelf kiezen aan welk project hun geld zou worden besteed en weten wat de resultaten van hun besteding waren. Het bleek bij veel grote en kleinere organisaties niet mogelijk om aan hun verzoek te voldoen. Net4kids is opgericht om deze wens te ondersteunen en meer mensen de mogelijkheid te bieden om meer projecten concreet te steunen. Op die manier wil Net4kids transparantie en betrokkenheid uitstralen. Op dit moment zetten ruim 30 mensen, waarvan het merendeel belangeloos, zich in voor Net4kids. 

Net4kids voert zelf geen projecten uit, maar werkt met projectpartners die zorgvuldig worden geselecteerd en gemonitord. 100% van de projectbijdragen gaat naar deze hulporganisaties, die op hun beurt weer garant staan voor een effectieve aanwending van de middelen.

In 1996 kwam Ellen Michaelis tijdens haar werkzaamheden in Zimbabwe in contact met hobby-imker en basisschoolleraar Michael Hlungwani. Honingjagen (honing vergaren) was algemeen gebruikelijk, maar met grote gevaren verbonden voor de bijen, omdat door gebruik van vuur het bijenvolk meestal vernietigd werd en veldbranden konden ontstaan. De honingoogst was klein. Michael was ervan overtuigd, dat scholing over bijenhouden ertoe zou bijdragen op veilige manier een grotere honingopbrengst te bereiken en daarmee voedsel en inkomsten te genereren. In 1997 volgde zijn vrouw Miriro een cursus bijenhouden. Na een succesvolle honingoogst werd de belangstelling van omwonenden zo groot, dat het echtpaar Hlungwani samen met hun dorpsgenoten de Kutsungirira Beekeeping Club oprichtten. Ellen was zeer onder de indruk van de grote mogelijkheden van bijenteelt voor de boerenbevolking en besloot zich te zetten voor de ontwikkeling van dit imkerproject.

Vrouwen, mannen, jongeren en kinderen (Aidswezen) kunnen er leren bijenhouden en door productie en verkoop van honing, bijenwaskaarsen en andere bijenproducten inkomsten verwerven. Ook worden fruitbomen en andere gewassen geplant om voor meer voedsel voor de bijen te zorgen. Bijen zijn belangrijk voor de bestuiving van wilde planten en bomen en landbouwgewassen. Goede bestuiving is cruciaal voor de plantendiversiteit en de landbouwoogst wordt erdoor verhoogt. De bijenhouders beschermen de bijen en hun natuurlijke leefomgeving.
 
Tussen 2000 en 2008 heeft de Kutsungirira Beekeeping Club  meer dan 200 nieuwe imkers opgeleid en zij zijn een eigen Imker Training en Marketing Centrum aan het bouwen. Honderden aspirant imkers staan op de wachtlijst voor training. 
Door het succes van deze club in Zimbabwe is het idee ontstaan, ook imkeropleidingen in andere landen te gaan ondersteunen. In 2004 ontmoette Ellen de Nederlandse imker Bert-Jan van Wichen, die ook enthousiast was, en samen hebben zij in december 2004 Stichting BeeSupport opgericht.
BeeSupport heeft sinds 2005 de Kesogon Self Help Group in Kenia ondersteund met geld voor imkertrainingen, voor materialen en gereedschappen voor het maken van bijenkasten en voor de bouw van een gemeenschapshal waar de imkercursussen worden gegeven. 
In 2008 is de samenwerking begonnen met de Rwenzori Mountains Development Association in Uganda. REMODA heeft BeeSupport via Internet gevonden en in september 2007 een aanvraag ingediend.
In Ethiopie is i.s.m. een vrijwilligster van BeeSupport een imkerproject in voorbereiding, gericht op imkeropleiding, honingproductie en marketing van honing en bijenwas.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:06.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting opgericht op 1-12 -2004

Live Build is opgericht door Douwe van Loenen, Ruurd van den Berg en Joris van Rest met als doel het bouwen van huizen, weeshuizen, scholen en ziekenhuizen overal ter wereld.


Zij hebben zichzelf volledig toegewijd aan de ontwikkeling van de organisatie. Na het opstart jaar in 2007 is Live Build in 2008 doorgegroeid naar een stevige organisatie die jong blijft denken. 


De stichting is ontstaan vanuit het idee van de oprichters dat een ontwikkelingshulporganisatie transparant, efficiënt en vernieuwend moet zijn. Door eigen expertise op het gebied van fondsenwerving  ontstond het idee om de fondsenwerving in eigen beheer te houden. Hiermee genereert Live Build veel meer en directer geld voor dat waar het voor bedoeld is. Hiermee is de basis gelegd voor de activiteiten van Live Build.


Live Build onderscheid zich door zichtbaar te zijn op plekken waar andere organisaties dat niet zijn. Live Build streeft naar zichtbaarheid voor de huidige jonge generatie en wil laten zien dat ontwikkelingswerk niet saai en stoffig is maar interessant. Daarom richt Live Build zich voor werving van donateurs en bewustwording binnen die jonge doelgroep onder andere op evenementen, festivals en het uitgaansleven. Daar waar het leven van jongeren zich bevindt.
 

Bouwen doet Live Build “live”. Alle projecten zullen door middel van foto’s en video’s op de site gevolgd kunnen worden. Zo kan iedereen zien wat er precies met het geld gebeurd.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:06.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Box 582","Ghana","","","","","","0233-(0)3820 24536","","","http://www.womghana.org","","","","","","","WOM is een Ghanese NGO zonder Nederlandse counterpart. Ze steunen weduwen op een paar kritieke punten: gerechtelijke bijstand voor de claim op land (zie hieronder), microkredietprogramma’s waardoor ze een eigen bedrijfje op kunnen starten, schoolgeld, boeken en uniformen voor hun kinderen en het bewust maken van hun rechten door bewustwordingsprogramma’s. (dit gebeurt trouwens eveneens met getrouwde vrouwen omdat dat potentiële weduwen zijn, mannen en traditionele leiders van gemeenschappen (vooral dit laatste heeft de laatste jaren vruchten afgeworpen). Het is nodig omdat de situatie van weduwen meestal aanzienlijk verslechtert na de dood van hun man aangezien ze niet het stuk land dat hij in zijn bezit heeft erven en er van ze verwacht wordt te hertrouwen met hun echtgenoots broer om voor de overleden man kinderen te blijven krijgen. Ook zijn er niet al te fijne begrafenisrituelen waarbij de weduwen soms beschuldigd worden van hekserij (en evt. moord op hun man). Als ze om deze redenen de familie verlaten is het lastig voor ze om in inkomen te voorzien en hun kinderen naar school te sturen. Als gevolg migreren veel weduwen met hun kinderen naar het zuiden en de grote steden op zoek naar werk; de kansen die WOM ze biedt is een manier om ze hier te houden en hun kinderen hier op te laten groeien. 

In 1993 is de organisatie gestart door Betty Ayagiba, een verpleegster en zelf een weduwe, die met eigen ogen zag hoe de weduwen niet hun doktersrekeningen konden betalen en haar collega’s georganiseerd heeft in een associatie. Inmiddels is WOM uitgegroeid tot een gerespecteerde NGO die in heel Ghana weduwengroepen heeft, hoewel ze vooral in het noordoosten actief zijn waar de meeste netwerken en contacten zijn opgebouwd. 

De permanente staf bestaat uit 8 mensen, en de directieleden zijn: Betty Ayagiba, Rev. Steven Apotara, Pastor (Mrs) Ivy Hiadzi, Madam Inniga Sulley, Madam Constance Holu, Madam Patricia Kaba, Madam Margaret Achana, Madam Mary Azusa, Mary Naah, Georgina Ollam en Grace Agoribire.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:52.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO

Thus, they decided to combine their efforts to support themselves and their communities. The idea of working in solidarity was stated by Mrs Ndikum Helen who is the Executive Director of Nest of Hope led to the creation a small group of women.

Wij bevrijden minderjarige meisjes uit bordelen in India en Cambodja en geven hen weer een toekomst.

Stop Kindermisbruik werft in Nederland fondsen en werkt in Azië samen met lokale partners die het echte werk doen. Bij Stop Kindermisbruik werken drie parttime medewerkers die zorgen voor de promotie van de stichting door onze ambassadeurs (Yolanthe Cabau van Kasbergen, Vivian en John Ewbank en Arjan Erkel) en de subsidieaanvragen.

Nederlandse projecten 
Sinds de oprichting zijn er veel projecten met hulp van Nederland in India tot stand gekomen. Het eerste project dat de stichting financierde was de bouw van een school voor kansarme kinderen in Jaipur. Deze Aravali school (waarin ook het kantoor van de organisatie is gevestigd) bestaat sinds 2005 en is inmiddels volledig zelfvoorzienend. In december 2000 werd een ander groot project gestart: het aanleggen van waterreservoirs bij dorpjes gelegen in het woestijngebieden rondom Jaipur. In de loop van drie jaar werden meer dan 60 reservoirs aangelegd, ruim 30 daarvan met hulp van de Nederlandse stichting.
Dit zijn nog maar enkele voorbeelden van grote projecten die vanuit Nederland zijn gesteund. Naast het steunen van projecten heeft Bal Rashmi Society Nederland voor veel kinderen aan de scholen van Bal Rashmi Society India schoolgeld betaald. Bal Rashmi Society Nederland wordt gesteund door een zeer trouwe groep particuliere sponsoren en heeft ook steun gekregen van 

Nederlandse NGO’s
Stichting Bal Rashmi Society Nederland is in 1998 opgezet door mw. Bé van den Bosch. Zij heeft de stichting opgezet nadat zij tijdens een reis door India in contact was gekomen met Alice Garg, de directrice van Bal Rashmi Society in Jaipur. Mw. van den Bosch was dusdanig onder de indruk van het werk van mw. Garg dat zij (in overleg met mw. Garg) heeft besloten haar te helpen door het financieren van enkele projecten. 
 
In 2007 werkte ik (Lieselot) via AIESEC 4 maanden als stagiair voor Bal Rashmi Society in Jaipur en de omliggende dorpen. Bij terugkomst heb ik contact opgenomen met mw. van den Bosch om te vragen of ik haar kon helpen. Het toeval was dat zij in verband met haar leeftijd net had besloten te stoppen met de stichting. Na overleg heb ik de stichting samen met Aniek Sarneel overgenomen.
 
Het doel van de stichting blijft ongewijzigd. Stichting Bal Rashmi Society Nederland ondersteund projecten van Bal Rashmi Society in Jaipur door ze (gedeeltelijk) te financieren. De professionaliteit van de organisatie maakt het onnodig en onwenselijk om vanuit Nederland veel invloed uit te oefenen op beleid en uitvoering van de projecten. 
 
Op dit moment zijn Aniek Sarneel en Lieselot Spliet de enige vaste betrokkenen bij het project. Waar nodig vragen wij vrienden en bekenden om assistentie.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:39:24.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:07.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvK nummer 27173446","stichtingbalrashmi@gmail.com","ING","68.21.00.986","","","Bal Rashmi Society","Haarlemmerweg 506-518","Netherlands","578","2010-06-20","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

I am a consultant in developmental work in developing countries, specialized in solar energy. Over the past four years, I have worked in Malawi, Argentina, and Tanzania on solar PV projects working extensively with rural communities.
The conception of this project though, goes back six years, when I was employed by the Belgian ngo APOPO in Morogoro, Tanzania. During the two years I lived there, I got to appreciate the splendour of the Uluguru mountains and made a special friendship with Saidi, gardener at APOPO, who lived in Choma village in the mountains. Saidi and I came up with the idea of a community based tourism initiative in Choma. Because my employment with APOPO ended and we did not have the necessary resources at the time, we couldn’t implement it but we stayed in contact over the past years and kept dreaming about our touristic project.
Now, 6 years later, I am working in Tanzania again and the time is right to make it happen! This project is a personal initiative that I am doing on a voluntary basis, besides my professional activities.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:43:56.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Self employed consultant in Belgium with Business Registration Number: 0835.652.030","carl.van.zand@gmail.com","KBC","731017317101","BE43731017317101","KREDBEBB","Karel Van Zand","KBC BANK ST.-TRUIDEN-CENTRUM, Grote Markt 9, Sint-Truiden, Belgium","Belgium","1372","2012-02-21","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

In the present, RJI is implementing volunteering programs and social corporate projects with different partners, in Central America

Since then, Reto Juvenil Internacional  has participated consistently  in over 540 community and environmental projects, as well as community training in different areas such as: agricultural production, environmental, conservation, nutrition, among other.  We have thus provided the opportunity to approximately 7500 volunteers from different countries to strengthen their abilities and develop new skills while contributing to the development of our communities.

This has placed Reto Juvenil Internacional in a position to celebrate cultural diversity and to contribute to sustainable human development, always with the firm intention to continue being the living expression of solidarity between all members of the global village. 

RJI`s trajectory was recognized with the Prize “Contributions to the Improvement of the Quality of Life,” sponsored by the Finnish government, granted by the Costa Rican Civil Rights Office, and the public Universities UNA, UCR, UNED and ITCR to those organizations concerned about ameliorating the life possibilities.

Doelstellingen zijn o.a. het verbeteren van de economische situatie van Zambianen die in het gebied rondom de missieposten (Chikankata en Ibbwe Munyama) van het Leger des Heils  wonen. Door kleinschalige projecten en ideeën van Zambianen te realiseren die meewerken aan een duurzame ontwikkeling van het gebied kunnen de inkomsten voor bewoners verbeteren en daardoor de levensstandaard.

Voorbeelden van deze projecten zijn het opstarten van kleinschalige toeristische activiteiten onder leiding van lokaal getrainde mensen en kleine leningen aan individuen, zodat ze kunnen investeren in hun bedrijfje. Verder zullen er in overleg met partnerorganisaties enkele activiteiten op het gebied van economie of landbouw gestart worden rondom de missiepost. Uitgangspunt bij alle projecten is dat het initiatief of de uitvoering ligt bij individuele Zambianen of lokale gemeenschappen, zoals vrouwen- of boerengroepen en dat zowel het individu als de gemeenschap en het milieu er beter van wordt.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:51:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KvK Haaglanden 27280519","p.duifhuizen@lukamantano.nl","","958449","","","Stichting Lukamantano","","None","68","2008-03-18","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Onder het motto van 'train de trainer' word een project medewerker van de partnerorganisatie getraind in het toepassen van theater-pedagogische vaardigheden tijdens het maken van een theatervoorstelling met de gezamenlijke doelgroep, namelijk de rehabiliterende straatkinderen. 
In Nederland versterken we tegelijkertijd op een creatieve manier actief het draagvlak voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Verder bestaan de activitieten in Nederland voornamelijk uit fondsenwerving, acquisitie, communicatie en p.r, draagvlakversterking en het uitvoeren van educatieve projecten in het basisonderwijs.

""My goal is to introduce orphans to surfing and let them enjoy the beauty of nature."" 
Rodney Westerlaken in Salt, May / June '08 

In order to be able to join the surflessons, the children have to follow a educational program first. With this program the children learn to respect nature. This respect is then again forced to enjoy by the elements that nature gives: the power of the waves. 

The ultimate goal for soul surf project Bali is not just about creating opportunities for young surftalents, but also to encourage children to develop themselves and to stand up for Mother Nature.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:03.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Yayasan.

Onze interesses en gemeenschappelijke doel om kwetsbare jeugd in ontwikkelingslanden een toekomstperspectief geven, heeft ons doen besluiten samen een project op te zetten. De training en daarmee het project is voor het weekend van 17 december 2010 afgerond met een presentatie over het behaalde eindresultaat: 4000,- Euro voor het opknappen van een basisschool in Lwengo, Oeganda.
We hebben zelf 1666,- Euro ingezameld en willen nu via 1%CLUB fondsen werven om alsnog ons streefbedrag van 4000,- te halen.



Eén van onze projectleden, Kitty, heeft begin dit jaar 2 maanden in Lwengo, Oeganda, gewerkt als vrijwilligerster. Zij is enorm geraakt door de ambitieuze, professionele plannen van de Lwengo Rural Development Support Organization - afgekort Lwengo - om kinderopvang en een basisschool in de community te verbeteren, zodat 570 kinderen vanaf 2011 een veel beter toekomst-perspectief hebben.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:46:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:09.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Vrijwilligersproject","info@toekomstinoeganda.nl","ASN Bank","707704200","","","Project Ebiseera ebijja","Alexanderstraat 28","Netherlands","898","2011-02-23","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Een van de bestuursleden van SSTZ, Mara Reijntjes, heeft van oktober 2006 tot april 2008 in Petauke gewerkt. Zij raakte daar erg onder de indruk van het werk van Titukuke en heeft de laatste 8 maanden ook voor Titukuke gewerkt. Toen ze terug was in Nederland heeft ze samen met familie en vrienden die haar in Zambia bezocht hadden in 2008 SSTZ opgericht.
Het bestuur van SSTZ bestaat uit Els van Gastel-Reijntjes en Akkie van Gastel in Doetinchem en Hanne de Leeuw en Mara Reijntjes in Amsterdam. 
De doelstelling van SSTZ is om Titukuke te helpen zoveel mogelijk kinderen naar school te krijgen.  Zonder onderwijs hebben deze kinderen geen enkele kans om aan de armoede te ontsnappen.

SSTZ heeft Titukuke tot nu toe geholpen door een bijscholing van twee leraren te bekostigen. Ook werd bij een school een latrineblok gebouwd. Voor 300 leerlingen was er namelijk geen enkele sanitaire voorziening.
Op dit moment –november 2009- zijn we bijna zover dat we kunnen starten met de bouw van een schoolgebouw voor 360 leerlingen. Voor de schoolbanken, schoolborden enzovoort hebben we geen geld. Daarvoor hebben we ons nu bij de 1% club aangemeld. Dit meubilair zal niet kant en klaar gekocht worden maar door lokale mensen gemaakt worden. Zodoende profiteren ook de lokale timmerlui van dit project.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:48:29.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting

Zij hebben ook in Sri Lanka een TRUST wat hen in staat stelt om betere contacten te leggen daar, die noodzakelijk zijn, om alles in goede banen te kunnen leiden, ook hebben wij nu een bankrekening in Negombo 
die alles automatisch regelt, wat inhoud dat de sponsorgelden van de Nederlandse gezinnen aan Sri Lankaanse gezinnen nu automatisch worden overgeboekt iedere 10e van de maand.
Verder heeft de Stichting al verschillende resultaten geboekt, zo hebben wij op een school in Pitipana van de ondergang gered, in Ethukala hebben wij een school voorzien van een geheel nieuw toiletten complex, moesten de kinderen op deze school voorheen hun behoeftes doen in het struikgewas, nu zitten ze lekker op een 
hygienisch toilet voorzien van stromend water en er zelfs een douche aanwezig. In Nilaveli hebben wij na de tsunami aan de bevolking 5 vissers boten geleverd voor 15 families, alles met motor en netten.
In Batticoloa heeft de bevolking 24 fietsen ontvangen.
Verder hebben wij nog enkele kleinere projecten, waaronder 3 mini krediet projecten, een ervan een nieuw op te zetten winkeltje, en wij hebben er 2 tuk tuk's op huur basis lopen.
Dan hebben wij nog een Montisorischool onder onze hoede die volledig afhankelijk is van ons.
Eind 2006 heeft Shantha middels onze hulp een nieuwe nier ontvangen en kan hij sindsdien weer een normaal leven leiden.

We geloven dat relaties net zo belangrijk zijn als geld en daarom steunen we mensen in Uganda. Theo Groot is iemand van onze gemeenschap die koos voor een leven in Afrika, hij is onze man ter plekke. Over de jaren werd hij een volwaardig lid van de lokale gemeenschap, deelt in de vreugdes en verdriet en kreeg vertrouwen en vriendschap. Hij deelt de dromen van de mensen voor een betere landbouw, kwaliteitsonderwijs voor hun kinderen en een eigen plek waar het goed toeven is. Als Bondeko besloten we hen te helpen deze dromen werkelijkheid te laten worden. Momenteel is de Bondekoschool het belangrijkste. (zie website)
Op verzoek van de lokale kerk (Church of Uganda) raakte Stichting Bondeko betrokken bij hun lagere school in het dorpje Kayunga, 20 km ten noordwesten van de hoofdstad Kampala. Sinds 2008 heeft Theo Groot samen met zijn Ugandese counterpart Stephen Galiwango op uitdrukkelijk verzoek van de kerk het management van de school overgenomen voor de komende 15 jaar. Dit is een enorm engagement waarvoor beiden zich volledig vrijwillig inzetten.
Momenteel telt de school 210 leerlingen. Er wordt kwaliteitsonderwijs gegeven aan kansarme kinderen uit de gemeenschap. Bijna 60% van de kinderen komt van één-ouder gezinnen, meestal zijn dat moeders, maar in toenemende mate grootmoeders die alleen voor de zorg van kinderen opdraaien. We zijn er trots op dat iets meer dan de helft van de kinderen meisjes zijn en dat ze ook de lagere school afmaken. Meestal zijn het de meisjes die tijdens de lagere school afvallen. De school heeft nu drie maal meegedaan met de nationale examens en elk jaar zien we grote vooruitgang in de resultaten die de kinderen behalen
Kwaliteitsonderwijs betekent voor ons dat we niet meer dan 30 kinderen in een klas hebben, dat we er voor zorgen dat er boeken zijn voor alle kinderen, dat we niet alleen hoofd, maar ook hart en handen ontwikkelen. En omdat bijna de helft van onze kinderen met een lege maag naar school komt, geven we ze maïspap voor de school begint en een simpele lunch van bonen en maïs. Verder zijn onze onderwijzers boven gemiddeld gemotiveerd en niet alleen omdat we ze iets meer (30%) betalen dan in het openbaar onderwijs.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:49:19.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting Bondeko is erkend als Algemeen Nut Beogende Intstelling, KVK nummer: 41193031;

Een passie om iets te doen voor een ander en een bijdrage te leveren aan betere levensomstandigheden voor mensen die dat nodig hebben. Geheel belangeloos en vrijwillig. Wij wilden graag onze vrije tijd en talenten inzetten om een verschil te maken in het leven van andere! En dat lukt heel behoorlijk, de stichting groeit flink door en inmiddels is in minder dan 2,5 jaar tijd bijna €60.000,- opgehaald! 

Inmiddels is Stichting Kwasa uitgegroeid tot een organisatie die meerdere partners heeft in Afrika waar ieder kwartaal het ingezamelde geld naar wordt overgemaakt. Dit kan alleen door de enthousiaste inzet van diverse vrijwilligers en de steun van veel donateurs.

Stichting Kwasa is opgericht om de levenskwaliteit van de bewoners in Afrika te verbeteren. Stichting Kwasa bestaat uit een enthousiast team van vrijwilligers. Die vrijwilligers organiseren allerlei initiatieven om geld in te zamelen voor projecten in Afrika. Projecten gericht op onderwijs, het verstrekken van microkredieten en de strijd tegen HIV / aids. Door samen te werken met een aantal kleine Non Profit Organisaties in Afrika is Stichting Kwasa in staat om tegen zeer lage kosten een groot verschil te maken. Doordat ze veel informatie geven over de bereikte resultaten – zowel aan vrijwilligers als donateurs – komt Afrika ineens heel dichtbij. Stichting Kwasa is opgezet door jongeren. Omdat zij het belangrijk vinden dat jongeren ook hun talenten inzetten om de wereld een beetje mooier te maken, biedt Stichting Kwasa Maatschappelijke Stage plekken aan. De stagiaires organiseren samen met de vrijwilligers initiatieven om geld in te zamelen, maar ook om andere jongeren enthousiast te krijgen voor vrijwilligerswerk.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:50:58.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:10.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting, KvK Nummer: 27326558","info@kwasa.nl","Rabobank Zoetermeer","145207722","","","Stichting Kwasa","Centrum West 35, 2711AA","Netherlands","865","2011-01-31","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

We'll launch the project with an initial 3-week campaign in July, during which we'll plant at least 5000 trees.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:47.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO (Registration No 100336)","marleen@greenpop.org","First National Bank","62332527029","","","Greenpop Zambia","82 Adderley Street","South Africa","1453","2012-04-16","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"
"001J000000sncS6IAI","false","","Green Waters","","","","Brittenoord 21","Rotterdam","","3079 KA","Tanzania","","","","","","0617446018","","","http://www.green-waters.org","","","","","","","De Green Waters organisatie werd gestart met een visie om vrouwen in Afrika te steunen. Deze organisatie is vóór vrouwen en wordt geleid dóór vrouwen met verschillende culturele achtergronden wiens missie het is om de effecten van armoede op vrouwen in Afrika te verzachten en om het milieu te beschermen.  

Door het creëren van alternatieve manieren van geld verdienen in landelijke gebieden, zullen de natuurlijke bronnen beschermd worden tegen exploitatie. 

Er zijn veel vrouwen in Afrika die in staat zijn om geld te verdienen, maar zij krijgen hier niet de kans voor. Hun activiteiten worden gelimiteerd tot traditionele methodes van een inkomen verdienen zoals het hakken van hout, het halen van water, veehouderij, het hoeden van kudddes, huishoudelijke taken en lokale handel en prostitutie. 

Deze activiteiten genereren niet genoeg inkomen en hierdoor moeten de vrouwen hun kinderen mee laten werken, wat de kinderen op jonge leeftijd al blootstelt aan grote risicos zoals een leven op straat, ongewenste zwangerschappen, prostitutie, abortussen en Seksueel Overdraagbare Aandoeningen. 

Deze kinderen zijn de volgende generatie, en hun gemiste jeugdjaren en gebrek aan sociale steun leidt vaak tot migratie naar de steden  en het betrokken raken in illegale/criminele activiteiten. Dit is een probleem dat veelvuldig voorkomt in de meeste stedelijke gebieden in ontwikkelingslanden, bijvoorbeeld in Dar es Salaam. 

Green Waters heeft als doel een sterke fundering en netwerken te creëren die de gemeenschap zullen helpen om cruciale zakelijke vaardigheden te ontwikkelen.
Deze netwerken zullen ook dienen als een motor voor een groei en het terugdringen van armoede.
We doen dit door mogelijkheden te creëren door middel van basis industrieën zoals de kleermakerij. Ons team van getrainde professionals zal betrokken zijn bij het gevecht om armoede in het hele land te verminderen. 

Ons eerste project is het creëren van een kleermakers industrie in Tanzania doormiddel het samenbrengen van gemotiveerde vrouwelijke kleermakers die nu nog onafhankelijk werken  en producten op bestelling leveren. 
Deze vrouwen zullen onder één dak samenwerken en begeleiding krijgen van een bekende lokale ontwerper, zodat zij standaard producten kunnen creëren waarmee zij een vast inkomen kunnen verdienen. 

In de tweede fase zullen stage plaatsen gecreërd worden voor ‘amateurs’ uit de gemeenschap, waarbij de focus zal liggen op plattelands vrouwen zonder academische achtergrond, straatmeisjes en andere minderbedeelde minderheden. 
Zij zullen getraind worden door de eerste groep professionele kleermaaksters in pilot projecten. 

In de derde fase zullen we manieren creëren zodat de producten verkocht kunnen worden, zowel nationaal als internationaal. 

Ons doel is om de vrouwen zekerheid te geven voor zowel henzelf als hun directe familie dor het creëren van mogelijkheden een vast inkomen te verdienen, waardoor zij zich ook een zorgverzekering kunnen veroorloven en regelmatig salaris ontvangen, een veilig systeem en een garantie voor het geval zij andere  ambities hebben, zoals het aanvragen van een hypotheek of het oppakken van een nieuwe studie. 

Hoewel het eerste doel de emancipatie van Afrikaanse vrouwen is via basis industrieën, richten we ons op het terugdringen van armoede in het hele land, en  het opzetten van een blijvende industrie om een veilige haven te creëren voor toekomstige generaties.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:42:47.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.

The new ICTs, in particular, email and the Internet facilitate communication with each other and the international community. Indeed, access to information about best practices, appropriate technologies, ideas and problems of other groups working on similar concerns have been identified as critical information and communication needs of women organisations in Africa.

While our emphasis is directed towards Internet technologies, we are also interested in how these technologies can be integrated with traditional means of information exchange and dissemination including radio, video, television and print media. Our goal is to improve conditions of life for women by enhancing their capacities and opportunities for exchange, collaboration and information sharing.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:55:55.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","NGO.

Established in 2005, the organisation is staffed by a group of young proactive youths who are convinced that development does not lie in the hands of the elderly alone, but also in those of the youths. The overarching goal of YPPD is to contribute to the endeavours of supporting youth development, peaceful conflict resolution, stability and sustainable development and peace and democracy in Sierra Leone. YPPD works to increase the capacity of vulnerable groups through training, partnership, advocacy, enhancing youth knowledge base and equipping them with livelihood skills. It is a platform for diverse kinds of actions committed to engaging key stakeholders at different levels of development across the country.

Our strategic programme areas include youth enterprise development, access to justice, gender empowerment through education and training, geared towards increasing youth capacity and knowledge in enjoyment of their human rights, fundamental freedoms and participation in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

This has subsequently made the organization one of the fastest growing youth organization in Sierra Leone and with a growing international membership of more than 250 young people the world over through the web-based social network called “yppd youth NetworK”


The organization however was borne out of the desire of bringing young people onboard who can serve agitators and agents of change and activists in their respective communities for the promotion of advocacy and youth empowerment in nation building. 

It holds a conviction on young people as agents of positivism in terms of national development, thereby strongly believing that as young people there is the call for us to come together and build the buoyancy needed in others, as a possible way of enabling youth in stepping forward for positive changes in our various communities and the world at large. With our vision, we develop insight from the daily struggles of our fellow young people who are marginalized and voiceless in the communities they live. This initiative is entirely managed for and by young people in Sierra Leone, which we consider as a novelty in the lives of every young person trying to make a change.

YPPD seeks to provide a ‘youthful voice’ that seeks to address the numerous challenges facing leaders of tomorrow by effectively using young resourceful minds to influence the course of inclusive policy formulation and development in a consistent and harmonized manner.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-04T07:56:24.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","","info@yppdatwork.org","First International Bank Sierra Leone Ltd.","00.101-10500-02","","FSTISLFR","Youth Partnership for Peace and Development","2 Charlotte Street, Freetown","Sierra Leone","520","2010-06-07","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Wij helpen de vrijwilligers die redding- en hulpverlening bieden aan de duizenden slachtoffers in het getroffen gebied Uttarakhand.
Description
De ramp vond plaats van 14 tot 17 juni in de Indiase staten Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh en Himachal Pradesh.
Door de hevige overstromingen en aardverschuivingen zijn tientallen duizenden slachtoffers (waaronder veel kinderen en ouderen) nu in wanhopige behoefte aan medische zorg, voedsel en evacuatie!
De gebieden zijn, gezien de ligging, erg moeilijk bereikbaar en de wegen naar minstens 2000 dorpjes zijn afgesloten. 

WAT DOET VERENIGING HELP INDIA 2013?
Wij helpen Team ""For Uttarakhand"" en een lokale NGO ""SAHIL"" door middel van een inzamelingsactie. 

Team 'For Uttarakhand' bestaat uit een groep van ervaren bergbeklimmers en rafters, die redding- en noodhulp verleent aan de slachtoffers in Uttarakhand. 

Team FOR UTTARAKHAND zorgt voor een supply chain systeem m.b.v. jeeps (waar mogelijk) en het aansluiten van de laatste weg met grote steden. 
Vanaf daar staan teams van minstens 15-20 mensen klaar om elk 25kg aan spullen te dragen (rantsoen, onderdak, brandstof, technische reddingsmateriaal etc) en trekken voor een dag of twee (of meer) naar afgelegen dorpen om de slachtoffers te bereiken. In sommige gevallen moeten ze ook een rivier oversteken en dan schakelen ze een rafting team in om voorraden naar de overkant van de rivier te brengen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-15T10:24:57.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Verening KvK nummer: 58.25.12.94","helpindiaoverstroomt2013@gmail.com","ING","6101232","","","Vereniging Help India 2013","Rotterdam","Netherlands","2086","2013-07-14","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Boerderij van Nambikay wil bijdragen aan een hoopvolle toekomst van mensen in het eerder door oorlog getroffen gebied van Noord en Oost Sri Lanka.

Hoewel de burgeroorlog in Sri Lanka voorbij is, is het leven van elke dag voor veel mensen een strijd. Ze hebben familie, bezittingen en toekomstperspectieven verloren en velen zijn getraumatiseerd.

In oktober 2012 is een begin gemaakt met het opstarten van een melkveebedrijf in Noord Sri Lanka. Het doel is bijdragen aan herstel van de lokale bevolking en de maatschappij. De boerderij toont een andere manier van bedrijf zijn: het biedt werkgelegenheid en is met het melkvee een model voor een andere manier van boeren in een gebied met vooral rijstteelt. Tevens zal 50% van de winst van het bedrijf worden gebruikt om kleinschalige projecten te ondersteunen. Deze projecten zullen gericht zijn op het herstel van mensen met een oorlogsverleden, hun integratie in de samenleving en het stimuleren van hun zelfredzaamheid. Met de rest van de winst wordt het bedrijf verder ontwikkeld.
Boerderij van Nambikay werkt samen met een comité van de lokale kerken om deze kleinschalige projecten te beheren en ook de activiteiten van deze kerken te ondersteunen. Daarmee wil Boerderij van Nambikay deze kerken versterken in hun missie om de hoop van Jezus Christus in woord en daad uit te dragen.

Majority of our interventions aims to benefit in child’s education, orphan and vulnerable children (OVC) as a consequence of HIV/AIDS, disabilities, child protection and abuse and street children.

In the process of carrying out these activities it has also gained immense grassroots experiences concerning the real life situation of the most vulnerable rural poor children in South Africa.

ILA’s interventions are characterised by the provision of practical and psycho-social support to children and women who do not otherwise have ready access to such services. Typical interventions include the education and training, provision of the holistic protection and care of orphaned and vulnerable children; the provision of food and nutritional supplementation to households threatened by malnutrition; and job creation to help alleviate poverty. 

The African children are at the heart of everything we do. ILA recognizes that no child lives in isolation, and for the child to truly benefit in any meaningful way, the basics of a stable and healthy community must come first. ILA is dedicated to working directly with children, their families and communities in devising, implementing and evaluating development projects that provide long lasting improvements.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-15T10:30:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:08.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","ILA is registered as a non-profit organisation by the South African Department of Social Development.

De stichting zet zich in voor de zigeunerkinderen in Oekraïne. Zigeuners hebben te maken met veel vooroordelen. Helaas bevestigen veel volwassenen deze vooroordelen nog altijd. Veel zigeuners drinken, stelen en frauderen. Werken of studeren gebeurt weinig. Om deze volwassenen te veranderen is een haast onmogelijke klus.

Om deze reden kiezen wij voor de zigeunerkinderen. Deze kinderen zijn de dupe van het gedrag van de volwassenen. De kinderen worden niet of nauwelijks verzorgt. Ouders vinden het belangrijker dat zij kunnen roken of drinken dan dat de kinderen goed onderdak, kleding en eten hebben. Ook wordt onderwijs vaak niet gestimuleerd. Wij hebben daarom een onderwijsprogramma opgericht om de kinderen een kans te bieden op een betere toekomst.

Wij willen de kinderen niet alleen iets leren,  maar we willen ook een goed voorbeeld voor hun zijn. Wij zijn er van overtuigd dat we met aandacht en liefde een mentaliteitsverandering bij de kinderen kunnen bewerkstelligen. Als zij dit weer doorgeven aan hun eigen kinderen, dan kan er op de lange termijn echt iets positief veranderen.","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-22T07:12:48.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","KVK nummer: 01165481","info@small-miracles.nl","ABN Amro","572506902","","","Stichting Small Miracles","Grote Oever 28","Netherlands","2106","2013-07-16","Crowdfunding Platform","false","false","false","","","","","","false","false","false","false","false","false","","","","","","","","","","No"

Ubuntu strives for a world in which any child feels welcome and can develop into a strong individual. We want to improve the perspective of street children in co-operation with our project partners in developing countries. To achieve this, we use the power of theatre to give the children their pride and self esteem back, to improve the position and basis of the partnering organisations and to create more involvement and a sense of responsibility in the child’s community. At the same time, we strengthen the basis for development aid in the Netherlands in a creative way. 

Vision
Every child, anywhere in the world, has a right to protection, development and survival. Ubuntu believes in theatre, creativity and inspiration as 
powerful tools to achieve this goal.
 
 
Objectives
Improving the perspective of street children by:
Making street children aware of their talents and qualities
Increasing self esteem and confidence in street children
Raising awareness and increasing involvement in the children’s surroundings regarding their well-being
Improving the capacity and foundation of local partner organisations that provide shelter for street children","","","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-25T11:37:49.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","005J00000018K40IAE","2013-07-29T12:49:11.000Z","","","false","","","0.0","0.0","","Stichting.
